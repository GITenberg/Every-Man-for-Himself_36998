<h1>EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>I—THE WAYFARER</h2>
<p>
The harbor lights were out; all the world of
sea and sky and barren rock was black. It
was Saturday—long after night, the first snow
flying in the dark. Half a gale from the north
ran whimpering through the rigging, by turns
wrathful and plaintive—a restless wind: it would
not leave the night at ease. The trader <em>Good
Samaritan</em> lay at anchor in Poor Man’s Harbor
on the Newfoundland coast: this on her last voyage
of that season for the shore fish. We had
given the schooner her Saturday night bath; she
was white and trim in every part: the fish stowed,
the decks swabbed, the litter of goods in the cabin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
restored to the hooks and shelves. The crew was
in the forecastle—a lolling, snoozy lot, now desperately
yawning for lack of diversion. Tumm,
the clerk, had survived the moods of brooding and
light irony, and was still wide awake, musing
quietly in the seclusion of a cloud of tobacco
smoke. By all the signs, the inevitable was at
hand; and presently, as we had foreseen, the
pregnant silence fell.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
With one blast—a swishing exhalation breaking
from the depths of his gigantic chest, in its
passage fluttering his unkempt mustache—Tumm
dissipated the enveloping cloud; and having thus
emerged from seclusion he moved his glance from
eye to eye until the crew sat in uneasy expectancy.
</p>
<p>
“If a lad’s mother tells un he’ve got a soul,”
he began, “it don’t do no wonderful harm; but
if a man finds it out for hisself—”
</p>
<p>
The pause was for effect; so, too, the pointed
finger, the lifted nostrils, the deep, inclusive
glance.
</p>
<p>
“—it plays the devil!”
</p>
<p>
The ship’s boy, a cadaverous, pasty, red-eyed,
drooping-jawed youngster from the Cove o’ First
Cousins, gasped in a painful way. He came closer
to the forecastle table—a fascinated rabbit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
</p>
<p>
“Billy Ill,” said Tumm, “you better turn in.”
</p>
<p>
“I isn’t sleepy, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“I ’low you better <em>had</em>,” Tumm warned. “It
ain’t fit for such as you t’ hear.”
</p>
<p>
The boy’s voice dropped to an awed whisper.
“I wants t’ hear,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Hear?”
</p>
<p>
“Ay, sir. I wants t’ hear about souls—an’
the devil.”
</p>
<p>
Tumm sighed. “Ah, well, lad,” said he, “I
’low you was born t’ be troubled by fears. God
help us all!”
</p>
<p>
We waited.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“He come,” Tumm began, “from Jug Cove—bein’,”
he added, indulgently, after a significant
pause, “born there—an’ that by sheer ill luck of
a windy night in the fall o’ the year, when the ol’
woman o’ Tart Harbor, which used t’ be handy
thereabouts, was workin’ double watches at
Whale Run t’ save the life of a trader’s wife
o’ the name o’ Tiddle. I ’low,” he continued,
“that ’tis the only excuse a man <em>could</em> have for
hailin’ from Jug Cove; for,” he elucidated, “’tis
a mean place t’ the westward o’ Fog Island, a
bit below the Black Gravestones, where the
<em>Soldier o’ the Cross</em> was picked up by Satan’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
Tail in the nor’easter o’ last fall. You opens the
Cove when you rounds Greedy Head o’ the Henan’-Chickens
an’ lays a course for Gentleman
Tickle t’ other side o’ the Bay. ’Tis there that
Jug Cove lies; an’ whatever,” he proceeded,
being now well under way, with all sail drawing
in a snoring breeze, “’tis where the poor devil
had the ill luck t’ hail from. We was drove
there in the <em>Quick as Wink</em> in the southerly gale
o’ the Year o’ the Big Shore Catch; an’ we lied
three dirty days in the lee o’ the Pillar o’ Cloud,
waitin’ for civil weather; for we was fished t’
the scrupper-holes, an’ had no heart t’ shake
hands with the sea that was runnin’. ’Tis a
mean place t’ be wind-bound—this Jug Cove:
tight an’ dismal as chokee, with walls o’ black
rock, an’ as nasty a front yard o’ sea as ever I
knowed.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ecod!’ thinks I, ‘I’ll just take a run ashore t’
see how bad a mess really <em>was</em> made o’ Jug Cove.’
</p>
<p>
“Which bein’ done, I crossed courses for the
first time with Abraham Botch—Botch by name,
an’ botch, accordin’ t’ my poor lights, by nature:
Abraham Botch, God help un! o’ Jug Cove.
’Twas a foggy day—a cold, wet time: ecod! the
day felt like the corpse of a drowned cook. The
moss was soggy; the cliffs an’ rocks was all a-drip;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
the spruce was soaked t’ the skin—the earth all
wettish an’ sticky an’ cold. The southerly gale
ramped over the sea; an’ the sea got so mad at the
wind that it fair frothed at the mouth. I ’low the
sea was tired o’ foolin’, an’ wanted t’ go t’ sleep;
but the wind kep’ teasin’ it—kep’ slappin’ an’
pokin’ an’ pushin’—till the sea couldn’t stand it
no more, an’ just got mad. Off shore, in the
front yard o’ Jug Cove, ’twas all white with
breakin’ rocks—as dirty a sea for fishin’ punts
as a man could sail in nightmares. From the
Pillar o’ Cloud I could see, down below, the
seventeen houses o’ Jug Cove, an’ the sweet little
<em>Quick as Wink</em>; the water was black, an’ the hills
was black, but the ship an’ the mean little houses
was gray in the mist. T’ sea they was nothin’—just
fog an’ breakers an’ black waves. T’ land-ward,
likewise—black hills in the mist. A dirty
sea an’ a lean shore!
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ thinks I, ‘’tis more by luck than
good conduct that you wasn’t born here. You’d
thank God, Tumm,’ thinks I, ‘if you didn’t feel
so dismal scurvy about bein’ the Teacher’s pet.’
</p>
<p>
“An’ then—
</p>
<p>
“‘Good-even,’ says Abraham Botch.
</p>
<p>
“There he lied—on the blue, spongy caribou-moss,
at the edge o’ the cliff, with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
black-an’—white sea below, an’ the mist in the sky an’
on the hills t’ leeward. Ecod! but he was lean
an’ ragged: this fellow sprawlin’ there, with his
face t’ the sky an’ his legs an’ leaky boots scattered
over the moss. Skinny legs he had, an’ a chest
as thin as paper; but aloft he carried more sail
’n the law allows—sky-scraper, star-gazer, an’,
ay! even the curse-o’-God-over-all. That was
Botch—mostly head, an’ a sight more forehead
than face, God help un! He’d a long, girlish
face, a bit thin at the cheeks an’ skimped at the
chin; an’ they wasn’t beard enough anywheres
t’ start a bird’s nest. Ah, but the eyes o’ that
botch! Them round, deep eyes, with the still
waters an’ clean shores! I ’low I can’t tell you
no more—but only this: that they was somehow
like the sea, blue an’ deep an’ full o’ change an’
sadness. Ay, there lied Botch in the fog-drip—poor
Botch o’ Jug Cove: eyes in his head; his
dirty, lean body clothed in patched moleskin an’
rotten leather.
</p>
<p>
“An’—
</p>
<p>
“‘Good-even, yourself,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘My name’s Botch,’ says he. ‘Isn’t you from
the <em>Quick as Wink</em>?’
</p>
<p>
“‘I is,’ says I; ’an’ they calls me Tumm.’
</p>
<p>
“‘That’s a very queer name,’ says he.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh no!’ says I. ‘They isn’t nothin’ queer
about the name o’ Tumm.’
</p>
<p>
“He laughed a bit—an’ rubbed his feet together:
just like a tickled youngster. ‘Ay,’ says
he; ‘that’s a wonderful queer name. Hark!’
says he. ‘You just listen, an’ I’ll <em>show</em> you.
Tumm,’ says he, ‘Tumm, Tumm, Tumm.... Tumm,
Tumm, Tumm.... Tumm—’
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t,’ says I, for it give me the fidgets.
‘Don’t say it so often.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Why not?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘I don’t like it,” says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, with a little cackle, ‘Tumm,
Tumm, Tumm—’
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t you do that no more,’ says I. ‘I won’t
have it. When you says it that way, I ’low I
don’t know whether my name is Tumm or Tump.
’Tis a very queer name. I wisht,’ says I, ‘that
I’d been called Smith.’
</p>
<p>
“‘’Twouldn’t make no difference,’ says he.
‘All names is queer if you stops t’ think. Every
word you ever spoke is queer. Everything is
queer. It’s <em>all</em> queer—once you stops t’ think
about it.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Then I don’t think I’ll stop,’ says I, ‘for
I don’t <em>like</em> things t’ be queer.’
</p>
<p>
“Then Botch had a little spell o’ thinkin’.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
</p>
<p>
Tumm leaned over the forecastle table.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said he, forefinger lifted, “accordin’ t’
my lights, it ain’t nice t’ see <em>any</em> man thinkin’:
for a real man ain’t got no call t’ think, an’ can’t
afford the time on the coast o’ Newf’un’land,
where they’s too much fog an’ wind an’ rock t’
’low it. For me, I’d rather see a man in a ’leptic
fit: for fits is more or less natural an’ can’t be
helped. But Botch! When Botch <em>thunk</em>—when
he got hard at it—’twould give you the shivers.
He sort o’drawed away—got into nothin’. They
wasn’t no sea nor shore for Botch no more; they
wasn’t no earth, no heavens. He got rid o’all
that, as though it hindered the work he was at,
an’ didn’t matter anyhow. They wasn’t nothin’
left o’things but botch—an’ the nothin’ about
un. Botch <em>in</em> nothin’. Accordin’ t’ my lights,
’tis a sinful thing t’do; an’ when I first seed Botch
at it, I ’lowed he was lackin’ in religious opinions.
’Twas just as if his soul had pulled down the
blinds, an’ locked the front door, an’ gone out for
a walk, without leavin’ word when ’twould be
home. An’, accordin’ t’ my lights, it ain’t right,
nor wise, for a man’s soul t’ do no such thing.
A man’s soul ’ain’t got no common-sense; it ’ain’t
got no caution, no manners, no nothin’ that it
needs in a wicked world like this. When it gets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
loose, ’t is liable t’ wander far, an’ get lost, an’
miss its supper. Accordin’ t’ my lights, it ought
t’ be kep’ in, an’ fed an’ washed regular, an’ put
t’ bed at nine o’clock. But Botch! well, there
lied his body in the wet, like an unloved child,
while his soul went cavortin’ over the Milky Way.
</p>
<p>
“He come to all of a sudden. ‘Tumm,’ says
he, ‘you is.’

<p>
“‘Ay,’ says I, ‘Tumm I is. ’Tis the name I
was born with.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You don’t find me,’ says he. ‘I says you <em>is</em>.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Is what?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Just—<em>is</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“With that, I took un. ’Twas all t’ oncet.
He was tellin’ me that I <em>was</em>. Well, I <em>is</em>. Damme!
’twasn’t anything I didn’t <em>know</em> if I’d stopped t’
think. But they wasn’t nobody ever called my
notice to it afore, an’ I’d been too busy about the
fish t’ mind it. So I was sort o’—s’prised. It
don’t matter, look you! t’ <em>be</em>; but ’tis mixin’ t’ the
mind an’ fearsome t’ stop t’ <em>think</em> about it. An’
it come t’ me all t’ oncet; an’ I was s’prised, an’
I was scared.
</p>
<p>
“‘Now, Tumm,’ says he, with his finger p’intin’,
‘where was you?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Fishin’ off the Shark’s Fin,’ says I. ‘We
just come up loaded, an’—’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘You don’t find me,’ says he. ‘I says, where
was you afore you was is?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Is you gone mad?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Not at all, Tumm,’ says he. ‘Not at all!
’Tis a plain question. You <em>is</em>, isn’t you? Well,
then, you must have been <em>was</em>. Now, then,
Tumm, where <em>was</em> you?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Afore I was born?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay—afore you was is.’
</p>
<p>
“‘God knows!’ says I. ‘I ’low <em>I</em> don’t. An’
look you, Botch,’ says I, ‘this talk ain’t right.
You isn’t a infidel, is you?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh no!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Then,’ says I, for I was mad, ‘where in hell
did you think up all this ghostly tomfoolery?’
</p>
<p>
“‘On the grounds,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘On the grounds?’ Lads,” said Tumm to
the crew, his voice falling, “<em>you</em> knows what that
means, doesn’t you?”

<p>
The Jug Cove fishing-grounds lie off Breakheart
Head. They are beset with peril and all
the mysteries of the earth. They are fished from
little punts, which the men of Jug Cove cleverly
make with their own hands, every man his own
punt, having been taught to this by their fathers,
who learned of the fathers before them, out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
knowledge which ancient contention with the
wiles of the wind and of the sea had disclosed.
The timber is from the wilderness, taken at
leisure; the iron and hemp are from the far-off
southern world, which is to the men of the place
like a grandmother’s tale, loved and incredible.
Off the Head the sea is spread with rock and
shallow. It is a sea of wondrously changing colors—blue,
red as blood, gray, black with the night.
It is a sea of changing moods: of swift, unprovoked
wrath; of unsought and surprising gentlenesses.
It is not to be understood. There is no
mastery of it to be won. It gives no accounting
to men. It has no feeling. The shore is bare
and stolid. Black cliffs rise from the water; they
are forever white at the base with the fret of the
sea. Inland, the blue-black hills lift their heads;
they are unknown to the folk—hills of fear, remote
and cruel. Seaward, fogs and winds are
bred; the misty distances are vast and mysterious,
wherein are the great cliffs of the world’s edge.
Winds and fogs and ice are loose and passionate
upon the waters. Overhead is the high, wide
sky, its appalling immensity revealed from the
rim to the rim. Clouds, white and black, crimson
and gold, fluffy, torn to shreds, wing restlessly
from nowhere to nowhere. It is a vast, silent,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
restless place. At night its infinite spaces are
alight with the dread marvel of stars. The universe
is voiceless and indifferent. It has no purpose—save
to follow its inscrutable will. Sea
and wind are aimless. The land is dumb, self-centred;
it has neither message nor care for its
children. And from dawn to dark the punts of
Jug Cove float in the midst of these terrors.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“Eh?” Tumm resumed. “<em>You</em> knows what
it is, lads. ’Tis bad enough t’ think in company,
when a man can peep into a human eye an’ steady
his old hulk; but t’ think alone—an’ at the fishin’!
I ’low Botch ought to have knowed better; for
they’s too many men gone t’ the mad-house t’
St. John’s already from this here coast along o’
thinkin’. But Botch thinked at will. ‘Tumm,’
says he, ‘I done a power o’ thinkin’ in my life—out
there on the grounds, between Breakheart
Head an’ the Tombstone, that breakin’ rock t’
the east’ard. I’ve thunk o’ wind an’ sea, o’ sky
an’ soil, o’ tears an’ laughter an’ crooked backs,
o’ love an’ death, rags an’ robbery, of all the
things of earth an’ in the hearts o’ men; an’ I
don’t know nothin’! My God! after all, I don’t
know nothin’! The more I’ve thunk, the less
I’ve knowed. ’Tis all come down t’ this, now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
Tumm: that I <em>is</em>. An’ if I <em>is</em>, I <em>was</em> an’ <em>will be</em>.
But sometimes I misdoubt the <em>was</em>; an’ if I loses
my grip on the <em>was</em>, Tumm, my God! what’ll
become o’ the <em>will be</em>? Can you tell me that,
Tumm? Is I got t’ come down t’ the <em>is</em>? Can’t
I build nothin’ on that? Can’t I go no further
than the <em>is</em>? An’ will I lose even that? Is I got
t’ come down t’ knowin’ nothin’ at all?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Look you! Botch,’ says I, ‘don’t you know
the price o’ fish?’
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says he. ‘But it ain’t nothin’ t’ know.
It ain’t worth knowin’. It—it—it don’t matter!’
</p>
<p>
“‘I ’low,’ says I, ‘your wife don’t think likewise.
You got a wife, isn’t you?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘An’ a kid?’
</p>
<p>
“‘I don’t know,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘You <em>what</em>!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘I don’t know,’ says he. ‘She was engaged
at it when I come up on the Head. They was a
lot o’ women in the house, an’ a wonderful lot o’
fuss an’ muss. You’d be <em>s’prised</em>, Tumm,’ says
he, ’t’ know how much fuss a thing like this can
<em>make</em>. So,’ says he, ‘I ’lowed I’d come up on the
Pillar o’ Cloud an’ think a spell in peace.’
</p>
<p>
“‘An’ what?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Have a little spurt at thinkin’.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘O’ she?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh no, Tumm,’ says he; ‘<em>that</em> ain’t nothin’
t’ <em>think</em> about. But,’ says he, ‘I s’pose I might
as well go down now, an’ see what’s happened.
I hopes ’tis a boy,’ says he, ‘for somehow girls
don’t seem t’ have much show.’
</p>
<p>
“An’ with that,” drawled Tumm, “down the
Pillar o’ Cloud goes Abraham Botch.”
</p>
<p>
He paused to laugh; and ’twas a soft, sad little
laugh—dwelling upon things long past.
</p>
<p>
“An’ by-and-by,” he continued, “I took the
goat-path t’ the water-side; an’ I went aboard the
<em>Quick as Wink</em> in a fog o’ dreams an’ questions.
The crew was weighin’ anchor, then; an’ ’twas
good for the soul t’ feel the deck-planks underfoot,
an’ t’ hear the clank o’ solid iron, an’ t’ join
the work-song o’ men that had muscles an’ bowels.
‘Skipper Zeb,’ says I, when we had the old craft
coaxed out o’ the Tickle, ‘leave me have a spell
at the wheel. For the love o’ man,’ says I, ‘let
me get a grip of it! I wants t’ get hold o’ something
with my hands—something real an’ solid;
something I knows about; something that <em>means</em>
something!’ For all this talk o’ the <em>is</em> an’ <em>was</em>,
an’ all these thoughts o’ the <em>why</em>, an’ all the crybaby
‘My Gods!’ o’ Abraham Botch, an’ the
mystery o’ the wee new soul, had made me dizzy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
in the head an’ a bit sick at the stomach. So I
took the wheel, an’ felt the leap an’ quiver o’ the
ship, an’ got my eye screwed on the old Giant’s
Thumb, loomin’ out o’ the east’ard fog, an’ kep’
her wilful head up, an’ wheedled her along in
the white tumble, with the spray o’ the sea cool
an’ wet on my face; an’ I was better t’ oncet.
The Boilin’-Pot Shallows was dead ahead; below
the fog I could see the manes o’ the big white
horses flung t’ the gale. An’ I ’lowed that oncet
I got the <em>Quick as Wink</em> in them waters, deep
with fish as she was, I’d have enough of a real
man’s troubles t’ sink the woes o’ the soul out o’
all remembrance.
</p>
<p>
“‘I won’t care a squid,’ thinks I, ‘for the <em>why</em>
nor the <em>wherefore</em> o’ nothin’!’
</p>
<p>
“‘N neither I did.”
</p>
<p>
The skipper of the <em>Good Samaritan</em> yawned.
“Isn’t they nothin’ about fish in this here yarn?”
he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Nor tradin’,” snapped Tumm.
</p>
<p>
“Nothin’ about love?”
</p>
<p>
“Botch never <em>knowed</em> about love.”
</p>
<p>
“If you’ll ’scuse me,” said the skipper, “I’ll
turn in. I got enough.”
</p>
<p>
But the clammy, red-eyed lad from the Cove
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
o’ First Cousins hitched closer to the table, and
put his chin in his hands. He was now in a
shower of yellow light from the forecastle lamp.
His nostrils were working; his eyes were wide
and restless and hot. He had bitten at a chapped
underlip until the blood came.
</p>
<p>
“About that <em>will be</em>” he whispered, timidly.
“Did Botch never say—<em>where</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“You better turn in,” Tumm answered.
</p>
<p>
“But I wants t’ know!”
</p>
<p>
Tumm averted his face. “Ill,” he commanded,
quietly, “you better turn in.”
</p>
<p>
The boy was obedient.
</p>
<p>
“In March, ’long about two year after,” Tumm
resumed, “I shipped for the ice aboard the
<em>Neptune</em>. We got a scattered swile [seal] off
the Horse Islands; but ol’ Cap’n Lane ’lowed
the killin’ was so mean that he’d move t’ sea an’
come up with the ice on the outside, for the wind
had been in the nor’west for a likely spell. We
cotched the body o’ ice t’ the nor’east o’ the
Funks; an’ the swiles was sure there—hoods an’
harps an’ whitecoats an’ all. They was three
St. John’s steamers there, an’ they’d been killin’
for a day an’ a half; so the ol’ man turned our
crew loose on the ice without waitin’ t’ wink,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
though ’twas afternoon, with a wicked gray look
t’ the sky in the west, which was where the
wind was jumpin’ from. An’ we had a red time—ay,
now, believe me: a soppy red time of it
among the swiles that day! They was men from
Green Bay, an’ Bonavist’, an’ the Exploits, an’
the South Coast, an’ a swarm o’ Irish from St.
John’s; they was so many men on the pack,
ecod! that you couldn’t call their names. An’
we killed an’ sculped till dusk. An’ then the
weather broke with snow; an’ afore we knowed
it we was lost from the ships in the cloud an’
wind—three hundred men, ecod! smothered an’
blinded by snow: howlin’ for salvation like souls
in a frozen hell.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ thinks I, ‘you better get aboard
o’ something the sea won’t break over. This
pack,’ thinks I, ‘will certain go abroad when the
big wind gets at it.”
</p>
<p>
“So I got aboard a bit of a berg; an’ when I
found the lee side I sot down in the dark an’
thunk hard about different things—sunshine an’
supper an’ the like o’ that; for they wasn’t no
use thinkin’ about what was goin’ for’ard on the
pack near by. An’ there, on the side o’ the little
berg, sits I till mornin’; an’ in the mornin’, out
o’ the blizzard t’ win’ward, along comes Abraham
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
Botch o’ Jug Cove, marooned on a flat pan o’
ice. ’Twas comin’ down the wind—clippin’ it
toward my overgrown lump of a craft like a
racin’ yacht. When I sighted Botch, roundin’
a point o’ the berg, I ’lowed I’d have no more’n
twenty minutes t’ yarn with un afore he was out
o’ hail an’ sight in the snow t’ leeward. He was
squatted on his haunches, with his chin on his
knees, white with thin ice, an’ fringed an’ decked
with icicles; an’ it ’peared t’ me, from the way
he was took up with the nothin’ about un, that he
was still thinkin’. The pack was gone abroad,
then—scattered t’ the four winds: they wasn’t
another pan t’ be seed on the black water. An’
the sea was runnin’ high—a fussy wind-lop over
a swell that broke in big whitecaps, which went
swishin’ away with the wind. A scattered sea
broke over Botch’s pan; ’twould fall aboard, an’
break, an’ curl past un, risin’ to his waist. But
the poor devil didn’t seem t’ take much notice.
He’d shake the water off, an’ cough it out of his
throat; an’ then he’d go on takin’ observations in
the nothin’ dead ahead.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ahoy, Botch!’ sings I.
</p>
<p>
“He knowed me t’ oncet. ‘Tumm!’ he sings
out. ‘Well, well! That <em>you</em>?’
</p>
<p>
“‘The same,’ says I. ‘You got a bad berth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
there, Botch. I wish you was aboard the berg
with me.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh,’ says he, ‘the pan’ll <em>do</em>. I gets a bit
choked with spray when I opens my mouth; but
they isn’t no good reason why I shouldn’t keep
it shut. A man ought t’ breathe through his
nose, anyhow. That’s what it’s <em>for</em>.’
</p>
<p>
“’Twas a bad day—a late dawn in a hellish
temper. They wasn’t much of it t’ see—just a
space o’ troubled water, an’ the big unfeelin’’
cloud. An’, God! how cold it was! The wind
was thick with dry snow, an’ it come whirlin’’
out o’ the west as if it wanted t’ do damage, an’
meant t’ have its way. ’Twould grab the crests
o’ the seas an’ fling un off like handfuls o’ white
dust. An’ in the midst o’ this was poor Botch
o’ Jug Cove!
</p>
<p>
“‘This wind,’ says I, ‘will work up a wonderful
big sea, Botch. You’ll be swep’ off afore
nightfall.’
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says he; ‘for by good luck, Tumm, I’m
froze tight t’ the pan.’
</p>
<p>
“‘But the seas’ll drown you.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I don’t know,’ says he. ‘I keeps breakin’
the ice ’round my neck,’ says he, ‘an’ if I can
on’y keep my neck clear an’ limber I’ll be able
t’ duck most o’ the big seas.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
“It wasn’t nice t’ see the gentle wretch squattin’
there on his haunches. It made me feel bad.
I wisht he was home t’ Jug Cove thinkin’ of his
soul.
</p>
<p>
“‘Botch,’ says I, ‘I <em>wisht</em> you was somewheres
else!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Now, don’t you trouble about that, Tumm,’
says he. ‘Please don’t! The ice is all on the
outside. I’m perfeckly comfortable inside.’
</p>
<p>
“He took it all so gracious that somehow or
other I begun t’ forget that he was froze t’ the
pan an’ bound out t’ sea. He was ’longside, now;
an’ I seed un smile. So I sort o’ got his feelin’;
an’ I didn’t fret for un no more.
</p>
<p>
“‘An’, Tumm,’ says he, ‘I’ve had a wonderful
grand night. I’ll never forget it so long as I
lives.’
</p>
<p>
“‘A what?’ says I. ‘Wasn’t you cold?’
</p>
<p>
“‘I—I—I don’t know,’ says he, puzzled. ‘I
was too busy t’ notice much.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Isn’t you hungry?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Why, Tumm,’ says he, in s’prise, ‘I believes
I is, now that you mentions it. I believes I’d
<em>like</em> a biscuit.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I wisht I had one t’ shy,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t you be troubled,’ says he. ‘My arms
is stuck. I couldn’t cotch it, anyhow.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Anyhow,’ says I, ‘I wisht I had one.’
</p>
<p>
“‘A grand night!’ says he. ‘For I got a idea,
Tumm. They wasn’t nothin’ t’ disturb me all
night long. I been all alone—an’ I been quiet.
An’ I got a idea. I’ve gone an’ found out,
Tumm,’ says he, ‘a law o’ life! Look you!
Tumm,’ says he, ‘what you aboard that berg for?
’Tis because you had sense enough t’ get there.
An’ why isn’t I aboard that berg? ’Tis because
I didn’t have none o’ the on’y kind o’ sense that
was needed in the mess last night. You’ll be
picked up by the fleet,’ says he, ‘when the weather
clears; an’ I’m bound out t’ sea on a speck o’
flat ice. This coast ain’t kind,’ says he. ‘No
coast is kind. Men lives because they’re able for
it; not because they’re coaxed to. An’ the on’y
kind o’ men this coast lets live an’ breed is the
kind she wants. The kind o’ men this coast puts
up with ain’t weak, an’ they ain’t timid, an’
they don’t think. Them kind dies—just the way
I ’low <em>I</em> got t’ die. They don’t live, Tumm, an’
they don’t breed.’
</p>
<p>
“‘What about you?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘About me?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay—that day on the Pillar o’ Cloud.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh!’ says he. ‘You mean about <em>she</em>. Well,
it didn’t come t’ nothin’, Tumm. The women
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
folk wasn’t able t’ find me, an’ they didn’t know
which I wanted sove, the mother or the child;
so, somehow or other, both went an’ died afore I
got there. But that isn’t got nothin’ t’ do with
<em>this</em>.’
</p>
<p>
“He was drifted a few fathoms past. Just
then a big sea fell atop of un. He ducked real
skilful, an’ come out of it smilin’, if sputterin’.
</p>
<p>
“‘Now, Tumm,’ says he, ‘if we was t’ the
s’uth’ard, where they says ’tis warm an’ different,
an’ lives isn’t lived the same, maybe you’d be
on the pan o’ ice, an’ I’d be aboard the berg;
maybe you’d be like t’ starve, an’ I’d get so much
as forty cents a day the year round. They’s a
great waste in life,’ says he; ‘I don’t know why,
but there ’tis. An’ I ’low I’m gone t’ waste on
this here coast. I been born out o’ place, that’s
all. But they’s a place somewheres for such as
me—somewheres for the likes o’ me. T’ the
s’uth’ard, now, maybe, they’d <em>be</em> a place; t’ the
s’uth’ard, maybe, the folk would want t’ know
about the things I thinks out—ay, maybe they’d
even <em>pay</em> for the labor I’m put to! But <em>here</em>,
you lives, an’ I dies. Don’t you see, Tumm?
’Tis the law! ’Tis why a Newf’un’lander ain’t
a nigger. More’n that, ’tis why a dog’s a dog
on land an’ a swile in the water; ’tis why a dog
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
haves legs an’ a swile haves flippers. Don’t you
see? ’Tis the law!’
</p>
<p>
“‘I don’t quite find you,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Botch shook his head. ‘They isn’t
enough words in langwitch,’ says he, ‘t’ ’splain
things. Men ought t’ get t’ work an’ make more.’
</p>
<p>
“‘But tell me,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“Then, by Botch’s regular ill luck, under he
went, an’ it took un quite a spell t’ cough his voice
into workin’ order.
</p>
<p>
“‘Excuse me,’ says he. ‘I’m sorry. It come
too suddent t’ be ducked.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Sure!’ says I. ‘<em>I</em> don’t mind.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘it all comes down t’ this:
<em>The thing that lives is the kind o’ thing that’s best
fit t’ live in the place it lives in</em>. That’s a law
o’ life! An’ nobody but <em>me</em>, Tumm,’ says he,
‘ever knowed it afore!’
</p>
<p>
“‘It don’t amount t’ nothin’,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tis a law o’ life!’
</p>
<p>
“‘But it don’t <em>mean</em> nothin’.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, discouraged, ‘I can’t talk
t’ you no more. I’m too busy. I ’lowed when
I seed you there on the berg that you’d tell somebody
what I thunk out last night if you got clear
o’ this mess. An’ I <em>wanted</em> everybody t’ know.
I did so <em>want</em> un t’ know—an’t’ know that Abraham
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
Botch o’ Jug Cove did the thinkin’ all by
hisself! But you don’t seem able. An’, anyhow,’
says he, ‘I’m too busy t’ talk no more.
They’s a deal more hangin’ on that law ’n I told
you. The beasts o’ the field is born under it, an’
the trees o’ the forest, an’ all that lives. They’s a
bigger law behind; an’ I got t’ think that out afore
the sea works up. I’m sorry, Tumm; but if you
don’t mind, I’ll just go on thinkin’. You <em>won’t</em>
mind, will you, Tumm? I wouldn’t like you t’
feel bad.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Lord, no!’ says I. ‘<em>I</em> won’t mind.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Thank you, Tumm,’ says he. ‘For I’m
greatly took by thinkin’.’
</p>
<p>
“An’ so Botch sputtered an’ thunk an’ kep’ his
neck limber ’til he drifted out o’ sight in the
snow.”
</p>
<p>
But that was not the last of the Jug Cove
philosopher.
</p>
<p>
“Next time I seed Botch,” Tumm resumed,
“we was both shipped by chance for the Labrador
from Twillingate. ’Twas aboard the dirty little
<em>Three Sisters</em>—a thirty-ton, fore-an’-aft green-fish
catcher, skippered by Mad Bill Likely o’
Yellow Tail Tickle. An’ poor Botch didn’t look
healthful. He was blue an’ wan an’ wonderful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
thin. An’ he didn’t look at all <em>right</em>. Poor
Botch—ah, poor old Botch! They wasn’t no
more o’ them fuddlin’ questions; they wasn’t no
more o’ that cock-sure, tickled little cackle. Them
big, deep eyes o’ his, which used t’ be clean an’
fearless an’ sad an’ nice, was all misty an’ red,
like a nasty sunset, an’ most unpleasant shifty.
I ’lowed I’d take a look in, an’ sort o’ fathom
what was up; but they was too quick for me—they got
away every time; an’ I never seed
more’n a shadow. An’ he kep’ lookin’ over his
shoulder, an’ cockin’ his ears, an’ givin’ suddent
starts, like a poor wee child on a dark road.
They wasn’t no more o’ that sinful gettin’ into
nothin’—no more o’ that puttin’ away o’ the rock
an’ sea an’ the great big sky. I ’lowed, by the
Lord! that he couldn’t <em>do</em> it no more. All them
big things had un scared t’ death. He didn’t
dast forget they was there. He couldn’t get into
nothin’ no more. An’ so I knowed he wouldn’t
be happy aboard the <em>Three Sisters</em> with that devil
of a Mad Bill Likely o’ Yellow Tail Tickle for
skipper.
</p>
<p>
“‘Botch,’ says I, when we was off Mother
Burke, ‘how is you, b’y?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, farin’ along,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says I; ‘but how <em>is</em> you, b’y?’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Farin’ along,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘It ain’t a answer,’ says I. ‘I’m askin’ a plain
question, Botch.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well, Tumm,’ says he, ‘the fac’ is, Tumm,
I’m—sort o’—jus’—farin’ along.’
</p>
<p>
“We crossed the Straits of a moonlight night.
The wind was fair an’ light. Mad Bill was t’
the wheel: for he ’lowed he wasn’t goin’ t’ have
no chances took with a Lally Line steamer,
havin’ been sunk oncet by the same. ’Twas a
kind an’ peaceful night. I’ve never knowed the
world t’ be more t’ rest an’ kinder t’ the sons o’
men. The wind was from the s’uth’ard, a point
or two east: a soft wind an’ sort o’ dawdlin’ careless
an’ happy toward the Labrador. The sea
was sound asleep; an’ the schooner cuddled up,
an’ dreamed, an’ snored, an’ sighed, an’ rolled
along, as easy as a ship could be. Moonlight
was over all the world—so soft an’ sweet an’ playful
an’ white; it said, ‘Hush!’ an’, ‘Go t’ sleep!’
All the stars that ever shone was wide awake
an’ winkin’. A playful crew—them little stars!
Wink! wink! ‘Go t’sleep!’ says they. ‘’Tis our
watch,’ says they. ‘<em>We’ll</em> take care o’ <em>you</em>.’
An’ t’ win’ward—far off—black an’ low—was
Cape Norman o’ Newf’un’land. Newf’un’land!
Ah, we’re all mad with love o’ she! Good-night!’ says
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
she. ‘Fair v’y’ge,’ says she; ‘an’
may you come home loaded!’ Sleep? Ay; men
could sleep that night. They wasn’t no fear at
sea. Sleep? Ay; they wasn’t no fear in all the
moonlit world.
</p>
<p>
“An’ then up from the forecastle comes Botch
o’ Jug Cove.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘you isn’t turned in.’
</p>
<p>
“‘No, Botch,’ says I. ‘It isn’t my watch;
but I ’lowed I’d lie here on this cod-trap an’
wink back at the stars.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I can’t sleep,’ says he. ‘Oh, Tumm, I
<em>can’t</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“‘’Tis a wonderful fine night,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says he; ‘but—’
</p>
<p>
“‘But what?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘You never can tell,’ says he
</p>
<p>
“‘Never can tell what?’
</p>
<p>
“‘What’s goin’ t’ happen.’
</p>
<p>
“I took one look—just one look into them
shiverin’ eyes—an’ shook my head. ‘Do you
’low,’ says I, ‘that we can hit that berg off the
port bow?’
</p>
<p>
“‘You never can tell,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Good Lord!’ says I. ‘With Mad Bill
Likely o’ Yellow Tail Tickle at the wheel?
Botch,’ says I, ‘you’re gone mad. What’s <em>come</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
along o’ you? Where’s the <em>is</em> an’ the <em>was</em> an’
the <em>will be</em>? What’s come o’ that law o’ life?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Hist!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Not me!’ says I. ‘I’ll hush for no man.
What’s come o’ the law o’ life? What’s come o’
all the thinkin’?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘I don’t think no more.
An’ the laws o’ life,’ says he, ‘is foolishness. The
fac’ is, Tumm,’ says he, ‘things look wonderful
different t’ me now. I isn’t the same as I used
t’ be in them old days.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You isn’t had a fever, Botch?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘I got religion.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh!’ says I. ‘What kind?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Vi’lent,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘I see,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘I isn’t converted just this minute,’ says he.
‘I ’low you might say, an’ be near the truth, that
I’m a damned backslider. But I <em>been</em> converted,
an’ I may be again. Fac’ is, Tumm,’
says he, ‘when I gets up in the mornin’ I never
knows which I’m in, a state o’ grace or a state o’
sin. It usual takes till after breakfast t’ find
out.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Botch, b’y,’ says I, for it made me feel awful
bad, ‘don’t you go an’ trouble about that.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You don’t know about hell,’ says he.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘I <em>does</em> know about hell,’ says I. ‘My mother
told me.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says he; ‘she told you. But you doesn’t
<em>know</em>.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Botch,’ says I, ‘twould s’prise me if she left
anything out.’
</p>
<p>
“He wasn’t happy—Botch wasn’t. He begun
t’ kick his heels, an’ scratch his whisps o’ beard,
an’ chaw his finger-nails. It made me feel bad.
I didn’t like t’ see Botch took that way. I’d
rather see un crawl into nuthin’ an’ think, ecod!
than chaw his nails an’ look like a scared idjit
from the mad-house t’ St. John’s.
</p>
<p>
“‘You got a soul, Tumm,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘I knows that,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘How?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘My mother told me.’
</p>
<p>
“Botch took a look at the stars. An’ so I, too,
took a look at the funny little things. An’ the
stars is so many, an’ so wonderful far off, an’ so
wee an’ queer an’ perfeckly solemn an’ knowin’,
that I ’lowed I didn’t know much about heaven
an’ hell, after all, an’ begun t’ feel shaky.
</p>
<p>
“‘I got converted,’ says Botch, ‘by means of a
red-headed parson from the Cove o’ the Easterly
Winds. <em>He</em> knowed everything. They wasn’t
no <em>why</em> he wasn’t able t’ answer. “The glory o’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
God,” says he; an’ there was an end to it. An’
bein’ converted of a suddent,’ says Botch, without
givin’ much thought t’ what might come after,
I ’lowed the parson had the rights of it. Anyhow,
I wasn’t in no mood t’ set up my word
against a real parson in a black coat, with a Book
right under his arm. I ’lowed I wouldn’t stay
very long in a state o’ grace if I done <em>that</em>. The
fac’ is, he <em>told</em> me so. “Whatever,” thinks I,
“the glory o’ God does well enough, if a man only
<em>will</em> believe; an’ the tears an’ crooked backs an’
hunger o’ this here world,” thinks I, “which the
parson lays t’ Him, fits in very well with the reefs
an’ easterly gales He made.” So I ’lowed I’d
better take my religion an’ ask no questions; an’
the parson said ’twas very wise, for I was only
an ignorant man, an’ I’d reach a state o’ sanctification
if I kep’ on in the straight an’ narrow
way. So I went no more t’ the grounds. For
what was the <em>use</em> o’ goin’ there? ’Peared t’ me
that heaven was my home. What’s the use o’
botherin’ about the fish for the little time we’re
here? I couldn’t get my <em>mind</em> on the fish.
“Heaven is my home,” thinks I, “an’ I’m tired,
an’ I wants t’ get there, an’ I don’t want t’ trouble
about the world.” ’Twas an immortal soul I
had t’ look out for. So I didn’t think no more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
about laws o’ life. ’Tis a sin t’ pry into the
mysteries o’ God; an’ ’tis a sinful waste o’ time,
anyhow, t’ moon about the heads, thinkin’ about
laws o’ life when you got a immortal soul on
your hands. I wanted t’ save that soul! <em>An I
wants t’ save it now</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says I, ‘ain’t it sove?’
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says he; ‘for I couldn’t help thinkin’.
An’ when I thunk, Tumm—whenever I fell from
grace an’ thunk real hard—I couldn’t believe
some o’ the things the red-headed parson said I
<em>had</em> t’ believe if I wanted t’ save my soul from
hell.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Botch,’ says I, ‘leave your soul be.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I can’t,’ says he. ‘I can’t! I got a immortal
soul, Tumm. What’s t’ become o’ that
there soul?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t you trouble it,’ says I. ‘Leave it be.
’Tis too tender t’ trifle with. An’, anyhow,’ says
I, ‘a man’s belly is all he can handle without
strainin’.’
</p>
<p>
“‘But ’tis <em>mine</em>—<em>my</em> soul!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Leave it be,’ says I. ‘It’ll get t’ heaven.’
</p>
<p>
“Then Botch gritted his teeth, an’ clinched
his hands, an’ lifted his fists t’ heaven. There
he stood, Botch o’ Jug Cove, on the for’ard deck
o’ the <em>Three Sisters</em>, which was built by the hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
o’ men, slippin’ across the Straits t’ the Labrador,
in the light o’ the old, old moon—there stood
Botch like a man in tarture!
</p>
<p>
“‘I isn’t sure, Tumm,’ says he, ‘that I wants
t’ go t’ heaven. For I’d be all the time foolin’
about the gates o’ hell, peepin’ in,’ says he; ‘an’
if the devils suffered in the fire—if they moaned
an’ begged for the mercy o’ God—I’d be wantin’
t’ go in, Tumm, with a jug o’ water an’ a pa’m-leaf
fan!’
</p>
<p>
“‘You’d get pretty well singed, Botch,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘I’d <em>want</em> t’ be singed!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well, Botch,’ says I, ‘I don’t know where
you’d best lay your course for, heaven or hell.
But I knows, my b’y,’ says I, ‘that you better
give your soul a rest, or you’ll be sorry.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I can’t,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘It’ll get t’ one place or t’other,’ says I, ‘if
you on’y bides your time.’
</p>
<p>
“‘How do you know?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Why,’ says I, ‘any parson’ll <em>tell</em> you so!’
</p>
<p>
“‘But how do <em>you</em> know?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Damme, Botch!’ says I, ‘my mother told
me so.’
</p>
<p>
“‘That’s it!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘What’s it?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Your mother,’ says he. ‘’Tis all hearsay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
with you an’ me. But I wants t’ know for myself.
Heaven or hell, damnation or salvation,
God or nothin’!’ says he. ‘I wouldn’t care if I
on’y <em>knowed</em>. But I don’t know, an’ can’t find
out. I’m tired o’ hearsay an’ guessin’, Tumm.
I wants t’ know. Dear God of all men,’ says he,
with his fists in the air, ‘I <em>wants t’ know</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Easy,’ says I. ‘Easy there! Don’t you
say no more. ’Tis mixin’ t’ the mind. So,’
says I, ‘I ’low I’ll turn in for the night.’
</p>
<p>
“Down I goes. But I didn’t turn in. I
couldn’t—not just then. I raked around in the
bottom o’ my old nunny-bag for the Bible my
dear mother put there when first I sot out for the
Labrador in the Fear of the Lord. ‘I wants a
message,’ thinks I; ‘an’ I wants it bad, an’ I
wants it almighty quick!’ An’ I spread the
Book on the forecastle table, an’ I put my finger
down on the page, an’ I got all my nerves
t’gether—<em>an’ I looked</em>! Then I closed the
Book. They wasn’t much of a message; it
<em>done</em>, t’ be sure, but ’twasn’t much: for that there
yarn o’ Jonah an’ the whale is harsh readin’ for
us poor fishermen. But I closed the Book, an’
wrapped it up again in my mother’s cotton, an’
put it back in the bottom o’ my nunny-bag, an’
sighed, an’ went on deck. An’ I cotched poor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
Botch by the throat; an’, ‘Botch,’ says I, ‘don’t
you never say no more about souls t’ me. Men,’
says I, ‘is all hangin’ on off a lee shore in a big
gale from the open; an’ they isn’t no mercy in
that wind. I got my anchor down,’ says I.
‘My fathers forged it, hook-an’-chain, an’ <em>they</em>
weathered it out, without fear or favor. ’Tis
the on’y anchor I got, anyhow, an’ I don’t want
it t’ part. For if it do, the broken bones o’ my
soul will lie slimy an’ rotten on the reefs t’ leeward
through all eternity. You leave me be,’
says I. ‘Don’t you never say soul t’ me no more!’
</p>
<p>
“I ’low,” Tumm sighed, while he picked at a
knot in the table with his clasp-knife, “that if I
could ’‘a’ done more’n just what mother teached
me, I’d sure have prayed for poor Abraham
Botch that night!”
</p>
<p>
He sighed again.
</p>
<p>
“We fished the Farm Yard,” Tumm continued,
“an’ Indian Harbor, an’ beat south into
Domino Run; but we didn’t get no chance t’ use
a pound o’ salt for all that. They didn’t seem t’
be no sign o’ fish anywheres on the s’uth’ard or
middle coast o’ the Labrador. We run here,’
an’ we beat there, an’ we fluttered around like
a half-shot gull; but we didn’t come up with no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
fish. Down went the trap, an’ up she come:
not even a lumpfish or a lobser t’ grace the labor.
Winds in the east, lop on the sea, fog in the sky,
ice in the water, colds on the chest, boils on the
wrists; but nar’ a fish in the hold! It drove
Mad Bill Likely stark. ‘Lads,’ says he, ‘the
fish is north o’ Mugford. I’m goin’ down,’ says
he, ‘if we haves t’ winter at Chidley on swile-fat
an’ sea-weed. For,’ says he, ‘Butt o’ Twillingate,
which owns this craft, an’ has outfitted every
man o’ this crew, is on his last legs, an’ I’d rather
face the Lord in a black shroud o’ sin than tie up
t’ the old man’s wharf with a empty hold. For
the Lord is used to it,’ says he, ‘an’ wouldn’t
mind; but Old Man Butt would <em>cry</em>.’ So we
’lowed we’d stand by, whatever come of it; an’
down north we went, late in the season, with
a rippin’ wind astern. An’ we found the fish
’long about Kidalick; an’ we went at it, night an’
day, an’ loaded in a fortnight. ‘An’ now, lads,’
says Mad Bill Likely, when the decks was awash,
‘you can all go t’ sleep, an’ be jiggered t’ you!’
An’ down I dropped on the last stack o’ green
cod, an’ slep’ for more hours than I dast tell you.
</p>
<p>
“Then we started south.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says Botch, when we was well
underway, ‘we’re deep. We’re awful deep.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘But it ain’t salt,’ says I; ‘’tis fish.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says he; ‘but ’tis all the same t’ the
schooner. We’ll have wind, an’ she’ll complain.’
</p>
<p>
“We coaxed her from harbor t’ harbor so far
as Indian Tickle. Then we got a fair wind, an’
Mad Bill Likely ’lowed he’d make a run for it t’
the northern ports o’ the French Shore. We was
well out an’ doin’ well when the wind switched t’
the sou’east. ’Twas a beat, then; an’ the poor
old <em>Three Sisters</em> didn’t like it, an’ got tired, an’
wanted t’ give up. By dawn the seas was comin’
over the bow at will. The old girl simply couldn’t
keep her head up. She’d dive, an’ nose in, an’
get smothered; an’ she shook her head so pitiful
that Mad Bill Likely ’lowed he’d ease her for’ard,
an’ see how she’d like it. ’Twas broad day when
he sent me an’ Abraham Botch o’ Jug Cove
out t’ stow the stays’l. They wasn’t no fog on
the face o’ the sea; but the sky was gray an’
troubled, an’ the sea was a wrathful black-an’-white,
an’ the rain, whippin’ past, stung what it
touched, an’ froze t’ the deck an’ riggin’. I
knowed she’d put her nose into the big white seas,
an’ I knowed Botch an’ me would go under,
an’ I knowed the foothold was slippery with ice;
so I called the fac’s t’ Botch’s attention, an’
asked un not t’ think too much.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘I’ve give that up,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says I, ‘you might get another attackt.’
</p>
<p>
“‘No fear,’ says he; ‘’tis foolishness t’ think.
It don’t come t’ nothin’.’
</p>
<p>
“‘But you <em>might</em>,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Not in a moment o’ grace,’ says he. ‘An’,
Tumm,’ says he, ‘at this instant, my condition,’
says he, ‘is one o’ salvation.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Then,’ says I, ‘you follow me, an’ we’ll do
a tidy job with that there stays’l.’
</p>
<p>
“An’ out on the jib-boom we went. We’d
pretty near finished the job when the <em>Three
Sisters</em> stuck her nose into a thundering sea.
When she shook that off, I yelled t’ Botch t’ look
out for two more. If he heard, he didn’t say so;
he was too busy spittin’ salt water. We was still
there when the second sea broke. But when the
third fell, an’ my eyes was shut, an’ I was grippin’
the boom for dear life, I felt a clutch on my
ankle; an’ the next thing I knowed I was draggin’
in the water, with a grip on the bobstay, an’
something tuggin’ at my leg like a whale on a
fish-line. I knowed ’twas Botch, without lookin’,
for it couldn’t be nothin’ else. An’ when I looked,
I seed un lyin’ in the foam at the schooner’s
bow, bobbin’ under an’ up. His head was on a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
pillow o’ froth, an’ his legs was swingin’ in a green,
bubblish swirl beyond.
</p>
<p>
“‘Hold fast!’ I yelled.
</p>
<p>
“The hiss an’ swish o’ the seas was hellish.
Botch spat water an’ spoke, but I couldn’t hear.
I ’lowed, though, that ’twas whether I could keep
my grip a bit longer.
</p>
<p>
“‘Hold fast!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“He nodded a most agreeable thank you. ‘I
wants t’ think a minute,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Take both hands!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“On deck they hadn’t missed us yet. The
rain was thick an’ sharp-edged, an’ the schooner’s
bow was forever in a mist o’ spray.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm!’ says Botch.
</p>
<p>
“‘Hold fast!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“He’d hauled his head out o’ the froth. They
wasn’t no trouble in his eyes no more. His eyes
was clear an’ deep—with a little laugh lyin’ far
down in the depths.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘I——’
</p>
<p>
“‘I don’t hear,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘I can’t wait no longer,’ says he. ‘I wants t’
know. An’ I’m so near, now,’ says he, ‘that I
’low I’ll just find out.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Hold fast, you fool!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“I swear by the God that made me,” Tumm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
declared, “that he was smilin’ the last I seed of
his face in the foam! He wanted t’ know—an’
he found out! But I wasn’t quite so curious,”
Tumm added, “an’ I hauled my hulk out o’ the
water, an’ climbed aboard. An’ I run aft; but
they wasn’t nothin’ t’ be seed but the big, black
sea, an’ the froth o’ the schooner’s wake and o’
the wild white horses.”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
The story was ended.
</p>
<p>
A tense silence was broken by a gentle snore
from the skipper of the <em>Good Samaritan</em>. I turned.
The head of the lad from the Cove o’ First
Cousins protruded from his bunk. It was withdrawn
on the instant. But I had caught sight
of the drooping eyes and of the wide, flaring
nostrils.
</p>
<p>
“See that, sir?” Tumm asked, with a backward
nod toward the boy’s bunk.
</p>
<p>
I nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Same old thing,” he laughed, sadly. “Goes
on t’ the end o’ the world.”
</p>
<p>
We all know that.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>II—A MATTER OF EXPEDIENCY</h2>
<p>
Sure enough, old man Jowl came aboard
the <em>Good Samaritan</em> at Mad Tom’s Harbor
to trade his fish—a lean, leathery old fellow in
white moleskin, with skin boots, tied below the
knees, and a cloth cap set decorously on a bushy
head. The whole was as clean as a clothes-pin;
and the punt was well kept, and the fish white
and dry and sweet to smell, as all Newfoundland
cod should be. Tumm’s prediction that he
would not smile came true; his long countenance
had no variation of expression—tough, brown,
delicately wrinkled skin lying upon immobile
flesh. His face was glum of cast—drawn at the
brows, thin-lipped, still; but yet with an abundant
and incongruously benignant white beard
which might have adorned a prophet. For
Jim Bull’s widow he made way; she, said he,
must have his turn at the scales and in the cabin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
for she had a baby to nurse, and was pressed for
opportunity. This was tenderness beyond example—generous
and acute. A clean, pious,
gentle old fellow: he was all that, it may be; but
he had eyes to disquiet the sanctified, who are not
easily disturbed. They were not blue, but black
with a blue film, like the eyes of an old wolf—cold,
bold, patient, watchful—calculating; having
no sympathy, but a large intent to profit, ultimately,
whatever the cost. Tumm had bade
me look Jowl in the eye; and to this day I have
not forgotten....

The <em>Good Samaritan</em> was out of Mad Tom’s
Harbor, bound across the bay, after dark, to
trade the ports of the shore. It was a quiet night—starlit:
the wind light and fair. The clerk
and the skipper and I had the forecastle of the
schooner to ourselves.
</p>
<p>
“I ’low,” Tumm mused, “<em>I</em> wouldn’t want t’
grow old.”
</p>
<p>
The skipper grinned.
</p>
<p>
“Not,” Tumm added, “on this coast.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, well, Tumm,” the skipper jeered, “maybe
you won’t!”
</p>
<p>
“I’d be ashamed,” said Tumm.
</p>
<p>
“You dunderhead!” snapped the skipper, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
was old, “on this coast an old man’s a man!
He’ve lived through enough,” he growled, “t’
show it.”
</p>
<p>
“’Tis accordin’,” said Tumm.
</p>
<p>
“To what?” I asked.
</p>
<p>
“T’ how you looks at it. In a mess, now—you
take it in a nasty mess, when ’tis every man
for hisself an’ the devil take the hindmost—in a
mess like that, I ’low, the devil often gets the
<em>man</em> o’ the party, an’ the swine goes free. But
’tis all just accordin’ t’ how you looks at it; an’
as for <em>my</em> taste, I’d be ashamed t’ come through
fifty year o’ life on this coast alive.”
</p>
<p>
“Ay, b’y?” the skipper inquired, with a curl
of the lip.
</p>
<p>
“It wouldn’t <em>look</em> right,” drawled Tumm.
</p>
<p>
The skipper laughed good-naturedly.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said Tumm, “you take the case o’ old
man Jowl o’ Mad Tom’s Harbor—”
</p>
<p>
“Excuse me, Tumm b’y,” the skipper interrupted.
“If you’re goin’ t’ crack off, just bide
a spell till I gets on deck.”
</p>
<p>
Presently we heard his footsteps going aft....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“A wonderful long time ago, sir,” Tumm began,
“when Jowl was in his prime an’ I was a
lad, we was shipped for the Labrador aboard the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
<em>Wings o’ the Mornin’</em>. She was a thirty-ton fore-an’-after,
o’ Tuggleby’s build—Tuggleby o’ Dog
Harbor—hailin’ from Witch Cove, an’ bound
down t’ the Wayward Tickles, with a fair intention
o’ takin’ a look-in at Run-by-Guess an’
Ships’ Graveyard, t’ the nor’ard o’ Mugford, if
the Tickles was bare. Two days out from Witch
Cove, somewheres off Gull Island, an’ a bit t’ the
sou’west, we was cotched in a switch o’ weather.
’Twas a nor’east blow, mixed with rain an’ hail;
an’ in the brewin’ it kep’ us guessin’ what ’twould
accomplish afore it got tired, it looked so lusty
an’ devilish. The skipper ’lowed ’twould trouble
some stomachs, whatever else, afore we got out
of it, for ’twas the first v’y’ge o’ that season for
every man Jack o’ the crew. An’ she blowed,
an’ afore mornin’ she’d tear your hair out by the
roots if you took off your cap, an’ the sea was
white an’ the day was black. The <em>Wings o’
the Mornin’</em> done well enough for forty-eight
hours, an’ then she lost her grit an’ quit. Three
seas an’ a gust o’ wind crumpled her up. She
come out of it a wreck—topmast gone, spars
shivered, gear in a tangle, an’ deck swep’ clean.
Still an’ all, she behaved like a lady; she kep’
her head up, so well as she was able, till a big
sea snatched her rudder; an’ then she breathed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
her last, an’ begun t’ roll under our feet, dead as
a log. So we went below t’ have a cup o’ tea.
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t spare the rations, cook,’ says the
skipper. ‘Might as well go with full bellies.’
</p>
<p>
“The cook got sick t’ oncet.
</p>
<p>
“‘You lie down, cook,’ says the skipper, ‘an’
leave me do the cookin’. Will you drown where
you is, cook,’ says he, ‘or on deck?’
</p>
<p>
“‘On deck, sir,’ says the cook.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll call you, b’y,’ says the skipper.
</p>
<p>
“Afore long the first hand give up an’ got in
his berth. He was wonderful sad when he got
tucked away. ’Lowed somebody might hear of it.
</p>
<p>
“‘You want t’ be called, Billy?’ says the
skipper.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay, sir; please, sir,’ says the first hand.
</p>
<p>
“‘All right, Billy,’ says the skipper. ‘But
you won’t care enough t’ get out.’
</p>
<p>
“The skipper was next.
</p>
<p>
“‘<em>You goin’, too!</em>’ says Jowl.
</p>
<p>
“‘You’ll have t’ eat it raw, lads,’ says the
skipper, with a white little grin at hisself. ‘An’
don’t rouse me,’ says he, ‘for I’m as good as
dead already.’
</p>
<p>
“The second hand come down an’ ’lowed we’d
better get the pumps goin’.
</p>
<p>
“‘She’s sprung a leak somewheres aft,’ says he.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
</p>
<p>
Jowl an’ me an’ the second hand went on
deck t’ keep her afloat. The second hand ’lowed
she’d founder, anyhow, if she was give time, but
he’d like t’ see what would come o’ pumpin’, just
for devilment. So we lashed ourselves handy an’
pumped away—me an’ the second hand on one
side an’ Jowl on the other. The <em>Wings o’ the
Mornin’</em> wobbled an’ dived an’ shook herself like
a wet dog; all she wanted was a little more water
in her hold an’ then she’d make an end of it,
whenever she happened t’ take the notion.
</p>
<p>
“‘I’m give out,’ says the second hand, afore
night.
</p>
<p>
“‘Them men in the forecastle isn’t treatin’
us right,’ says Jowl. ‘They ought t’ lend a
hand.’
</p>
<p>
“The second hand bawled down t’ the crew;
but nar a man would come on deck.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jowl,’ says he, ‘you have a try.’
</p>
<p>
“Jowl went down an’ complained; but it didn’t
do no good. They was all so sick they wouldn’t
answer. So the second hand ’lowed he’d go
down an’ argue, which he foolishly done—an’
never come back. An’ when I went below t’
rout un out of it, he was stowed away in his bunk,
all out o’ sorts an’ wonderful melancholy. ‘Isn’t
no use, Tumm,’ says he. ‘<em>It</em> isn’t no use.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Get out o’ this!’ says the cook. ‘You woke
me up!’
</p>
<p>
“I ’lowed the forecastle air wouldn’t be long
about persuadin’ me to the first hand’s sinful way
o’ thinkin’. An’ when I got on deck the gale
tasted sweet.
</p>
<p>
“‘They isn’t <em>treatin’</em> us right,’ says Jowl.
</p>
<p>
“‘I ’low you’re right,’ says I, ‘but what you
goin’ t’ do?’
</p>
<p>
“‘What you think?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Pump,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Might’s well,’ says he. ‘She’s fillin’ up.’
</p>
<p>
“We kep’ pumpin’ away, steady enough, till
dawn, which fagged us wonderful. The way
she rolled an’ pitched, an’ the way the big white,
sticky, frosty seas broke over us, an’ the way the
wind pelted us with rain an’ hail, an’ the blackness
o’ the sky, was <em>mean</em>—just almighty careless
an’ mean. An’ pumpin’ didn’t seem t’ do no
good; for why? <em>we</em> couldn’t save the hulk—not us
two. As it turned out, if the crew had been fitted
out with men’s stomachs we might have weathered
it out, an’ gone down the Labrador, an’ got
a load; for every vessel that got there that season
come home fished t’ the gunwales. But we didn’t
know it then. Jowl growled all night to hisself
about the way we was treated. The wind carried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
most o’ the blasphemy out t’ sea, where they
wasn’t no lad t’ corrupt, an’ at scattered times a
big sea would make Jowl splutter, but I heared
enough t’ make me smell the devil, an’ when I
seed Jowl’s face by the first light I ’lowed his
angry feelin’s had riz to a ridiculous extent, so
that they was something more’n the weather gone
wild in my whereabouts.
</p>
<p>
“‘What’s gone along o’ you?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘The swine!’ says he. ‘Come below, Tumm,’
says he, ‘an’ we’ll give un a dose o’ fists an’ feet.’
</p>
<p>
“So down we went, an’ we had the whole crew
in a heap on the forecastle floor afore they woke
up. Ecod! what a mess o’ green faces! A
per-feck-ly limp job lot o’ humanity! Not a backbone
among un. An’ all on account o’ their
stomachs! It made me sick an’ mad t’ see un.
The cook was the worst of un; said we’d gone an’
woke un up, just when he’d got t’ sleep an’ forgot
it all. Good Lord! ‘You gone an’ made me
remember!’ says he. At that, Jowl let un have
it; but the cook only yelped an’ crawled back in
his bunk, wipin’ the blood from his chin. For
twenty minutes an’ more we labored with them
sea-sick sailors, with fists an’ feet, as Jowl had
prescribed. They wasn’t no mercy begged nor
showed. We hit what we seen, pickin’ the tender
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
places with care, an’ they grunted an’ crawled back
like rats; an’ out they come again, head foremost
or feet, as happened. I never seed the like of it.
You could treat un most scandalous, an’ they’d
do nothin’ but whine an’ crawl away. ’Twas
enough t’ disgust you with your own flesh an’
bones! Jowl ’lowed he’d cure the skipper, whatever
come of it, an’ laid his head open with a birch
billet. The skipper didn’t whimper no more, but
just fell back in the bunk, an’ lied still. Jowl
said he’d be cured when he come to. Maybe he
was; but ’tis my own opinion that Jowl killed un,
then an’ there, an’ that he never <em>did</em> come to.
Whatever, ’twas all lost labor; we didn’t work a
single cure, an’ we had t’ make a run for the deck,
all of a sudden, t’ make peace with our own
stomachs.
</p>
<p>
“‘The swine!’ says Jowl. ‘Let un drown!’
</p>
<p>
“I ’lowed we’d better pump; but Jowl wouldn’t
hear to it. Not he! No sir! He’d see the
whole herd o’ pigs sunk afore he’d turn a finger!
</p>
<p>
“‘<em>Me</em> pump!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘You better,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘For what?’
</p>
<p>
“‘For your life,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘An’ save them swine in the forecastle?’ says
he. ‘Not <em>me</em>!’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
</p>
<p>
“I ’lowed it didn’t matter, anyhow, for ’twas
only a question o’ keepin’ the <em>Wings o’ the
Mornin’</em> out o’ the grave for a spell longer than
she might have stayed of her own notion. But,
thinks I, I’ll pump, whatever, t’ pass time; an’
so I set to, an’ kep’ at it. The wind was real
vicious, an’ the seas was breakin’ over us, fore an’
aft an’ port an’ starboard, t’ suit their fancy, an’
the wreck o’ the <em>Wings o’ the Mornin’</em> wriggled
an’ bounced in a way t’ s’prise the righteous, an’
the black sky was pourin’ buckets o’ rain an’
hail on all the world, an’ the wind was makin’
knotted whips o’ both. It wasn’t agreeable, an’
by-an’-by my poor brains was fair riled t’ see the
able-bodied Jowl with nothin’ t’ do but dodge
the seas an’ keep hisself from bein’ pitched over-board.
’Twas a easy berth <em>he</em> had! But <em>I</em> was
busy.
</p>
<p>
“‘Look you, Jowl,’ sings I, ‘you better take
a spell at the pump.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Me?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Yes, <em>you</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh no!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘You think I’m goin’ t’ do all this labor single-handed?’
says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘’Tis your own notion,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘I’ll see you sunk, Jowl!’ says I, ‘afore I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
pumps another stroke. If you wants t’ drown
afore night I’ll not hinder. Oh no, Mister Jowl!’
says I. ‘I’ll not be standin’ in your light.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘I got a idea.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Dear man!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘The wind’s moderatin’,’ says he, ‘an’ it
won’t be long afore the sea gets civil. But
the <em>Wings o’ the Mornin’</em> won’t float overlong.
She’ve been settlin’ hasty for the last hour. Still
an’ all, I ’low I got time t’ make a raft, which
I’ll do.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Look!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“Off near where the sun was settin’ the clouds
broke. ’Twas but a slit, but it let loose a flood
o’ red light. ’Twas a bloody sky an’ sea—red
as shed blood, but full o’ the promise o’ peace
which follows storm, as the good God directs.
</p>
<p>
“‘I ’low,’ says he, ‘the wind will go down
with the sun.’
</p>
<p>
“The vessel was makin’ heavy labor of it.
‘I bets you,’ says I, ‘the <em>Wings o’ the Mornin’</em>
beats un both.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Time’ll tell,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“I give un a hand with the raft. An’ hard
work ’twas; never knowed no harder, before nor
since, with the seas comin’ overside, an’ the deck
pitchin’ like mad, an’ the night droppin’ down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
Ecod! but I isn’t able t’ tell you. I forgets what
we done in the red light o’ that day. ’Twas
labor for giants an’ devils! But we had the raft
in the water afore dark, ridin’ in the lee, off the
hulk. It didn’t look healthy, an’ was by no
means invitin’; but the <em>Wings o’ the Mornin’</em> was
about t’ bow an’ retire, if the signs spoke true,
an’ the raft was the only hope in all the brutal
world. I took kindly t’ the crazy thing—I ’low I
did!
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says Jowl, ‘I ’low you thinks you
got some rights in that raft.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I do,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘But you isn’t,’ says he. ‘You isn’t, Tumm,
because I’m a sight bigger ’n you, an’ could put
you off. It isn’t in my mind t’ do it—but I
<em>could</em>. I wants company, Tumm, for it looks
like a long v’y’ge, an’ I’m ’lowin’ t’ have you.’
</p>
<p>
“‘What about the crew?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘They isn’t room for more’n two on that raft,’
says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Dear God! Jowl,’ says I, ‘what you goin’
t’ do?’
</p>
<p>
“‘I’m goin’ t’ try my level best,’ says he, ‘t’
get home t’ my wife an’ kid; for they’d be wonderful
disappointed if I didn’t turn up.’
</p>
<p>
“‘But the crew’s got wives an’ kids!’ says I.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘An’ bad stomachs,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jowl,’ says I, ‘she’s sinkin’ fast.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Then I ’low we better make haste.’
</p>
<p>
“I started for’ard.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘don’t you go another step.
If them swine in the forecastle knowed they was
a raft ’longside, they’d steal it. It won’t <em>hold</em> un,
Tumm. It won’t hold more’n two, an’, ecod!’
says he, with a look at the raft, ‘I’m doubtin’
that she’s able for <em>that</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“It made me shiver.
</p>
<p>
“‘No, sir!’ says he. ‘I ’low she won’t hold
more’n one.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh yes, she will, Jowl!’ says I. ‘Dear man!
yes; she’s able for two.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Maybe,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Handy!’ says I. ‘Oh, handy, man!’
</p>
<p>
“‘We’ll try,’ says he, ‘whatever comes of it.
An’ if she makes bad weather, why, you can—’
</p>
<p>
“He stopped.
</p>
<p>
“‘Why don’t you say the rest?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘I hates to.’
</p>
<p>
“‘What do you mean?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Why, damme! Tumm,’ says he, ‘I mean
that you can get <em>off</em>. What <em>else</em> would I mean?’
</p>
<p>
“Lord! I didn’t know!
</p>
<p>
“‘Well?’ says he.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘It ain’t very kind,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘What would <em>you</em> do,’ says he, ‘if <em>you</em> was
me?’
</p>
<p>
“I give un a look that told un, an’ ’twas against
my will I done it.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘you can’t blame me, then.’
</p>
<p>
“No more I could.
</p>
<p>
“‘Now I’ll get the grub from the forecastle,
lad,’ says he, ‘an’ we’ll cast off. The <em>Wings o’
the Mornin’</em> isn’t good for more’n half an hour
more. You bide on deck, Tumm, an’ leave the
swine t’ me.’
</p>
<p>
Then he went below.
</p>
<p>
“‘All right,’ says he, when he come on deck.
‘Haul in the line.’ We lashed a water-cask an’
a grub-box t’ the raft. ‘Now, Tumm,’ says he,
‘we can take it easy. We won’t be in no haste
t’ leave, for I ’low ’tis more comfortable here.
Looks t’ me like more moderate weather. I
feels pretty good, Tumm, with all the work done,
an’ nothin’ t’ do but get aboard.’ He sung the
long-metre doxology. ‘Look how the wind’s
dropped!’ says he. ‘Why, lad, we might have
saved the <em>Wings o’ the Mornin’</em> if them pigs had
done their dooty last night. But ’tis too late
now—an’ it’s <em>been</em> too late all day long. We’ll
have a spell o’ quiet,’ says he, ‘when the sea goes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
down. Looks t’ me like the v’y’ge might be
pleasant, once we gets through the night. I ’low
the stars’ll be peepin’ afore mornin’. It’ll be a
comfort t’ see the little mites. I loves t’ know
they’re winkin’ overhead. They makes me think
o’ God. You isn’t got a top-coat, is you, lad?’
says he. ‘Well, you better get it, then. I’ll
trust you in the forecastle, Tumm, for I knows
you wouldn’t wrong me, an’ you’ll need that top-coat
bad afore we’re picked up. An’ if you got
your mother’s Bible in your nunny-bag, or anything
like that you wants t’ save, you better fetch
it,’ says he. ‘I ’low we’ll get out o’ this mess,
an’ we don’t want t’ have anything t’ regret.’
</p>
<p>
“I got my mother’s Bible.
</p>
<p>
“‘Think we better cast off?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“I did. The <em>Wings o’ the Mornin’</em> was ridin’
too low an’ easy for me t’ rest; an’ the wind had
fell to a soft breeze, an’ they wasn’t no more rain,
an’ no more dusty spray, an’ no more breakin’
waves. They was a shade on the sea—the first
shadow o’ the night—t’ hide what we’d leave behind.
</p>
<p>
“‘We better leave her,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Then all aboard!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“An’ we got aboard, an’ cut the cable, an’
slipped away on a soft, black sea, far into the
night.... An’ no man ever seed the <em>Wings o’ the Mornin’</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
again.... An’ me an Jowl was picked
up, half dead o’ thirst an’ starvation, twelve
days later, by ol’ Cap’n Loop, o’ the Black
Bay mail-boat, as she come around Toad Point,
bound t’ Burnt Harbor....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“Jowl an’ me,” Tumm resumed, “fished the
Holy Terror Tickles o’ the Labrador in the <em>Got
It</em> nex’ season. He was a wonderful kind man,
Jowl was—so pious, an’ soft t’ speak, an’ honest,
an’ willin’ for his labor. At midsummer I got a
bad hand, along of a cut with the splittin’-knife,
an’ nothin’ would do Jowl but he’d lance it, an’
wash it, an’ bind it, like a woman, an’ do so much
o’ my labor as he was able for, like a man. I
fair got t’ <em>like</em> that lad o’ his—though ’twas but a
young feller t’ home, at the time—for Jowl was
forever talkin’ o’ Toby this an’ Toby that—not
boastful gabble, but just tender an’ nice t’ hear.
An’ a fine lad, by all accounts: a dutiful lad, brave
an’ strong, if given overmuch t’ yieldin’ the road
t’ save trouble, as Jowl said. I ’lowed, one
night, when the <em>Got It</em> was bound home, with all
the load the salt would give her, that I’d sort o’
like t’ know the lad that Jowl had.
</p>
<p>
“‘Why don’t you fetch un down the Labrador?’
says I.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘His schoolin’,’ says Jowl.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says he; ‘his mother’s wonderful particular
about the schoolin’.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Anyhow,’ says I, ‘the schoolin’ won’t go on
for all time.’
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says Jowl, ‘it won’t. An’ I’m ’lowin’
t’ harden Toby up a bit nex’ spring.’
</p>
<p>
“‘T’ the ice?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says he; ‘if I can overcome his mother.’
</p>
<p>
“‘’Tis a rough way t’ break a lad,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘So much the better,’ says he. ‘It don’t take
so long. Nothin’ like a sealin’ v’y’ge,’ says he,
‘t’ harden a lad. An’ if you comes along,
Tumm,’ says he, ‘why, I won’t complain. I’m
’lowin’ t’ ship with Skipper Tommy Jump o’ the
<em>Second t’ None</em>. She’s a tight schooner, o’ the
Tiddle build, an’ I ’low Tommy Jump will get a
load o’ fat, whatever comes of it. You better
join, Tumm,’ says he, ‘an’ we’ll all be t’gether.
I’m wantin’ you t’ get acquainted with Toby, an’
lend a hand with his education, which you can do
t’ the queen’s taste, bein’ near of his age.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I’ll do it, Jowl,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“An’ I done it; an’ afore we was through, I
wisht I hadn’t.”
</p>
<p>
Tumm paused.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
</p>
<p>
“An’ I done it—nex’ March—shipped along
o’ Tommy Jump o’ the <em>Second t’ None</em>, with
Jowl an’ his lad aboard,” he proceeded.
</p>
<p>
“‘You overcame the wife,’ says I, ‘didn’t
you?’
</p>
<p>
“‘’Twas a tough job,’ says he. ‘She ’lowed
the boy might come t’ harm, an’ wouldn’t give un
up; but me an’ Toby pulled t’gether, an’ managed
her, the day afore sailin’. She cried a wonderful
lot; but, Lord! that’s only the way o’ women.’
</p>
<p>
“A likely lad o’ sixteen, this Toby—blue-eyed
an’ fair, with curly hair an’ a face full o’ blushes.
Polite as a girl, which is much too polite for
safety at the ice. He’d make way for them that
blustered; but he done it with such an air that we
wasn’t no more’n off the Goggles afore the whole
crew was all makin’ way for he. So I ’lowed he’d
<em>do</em>—that he’d be took care of, just for love. But
Jowl wasn’t o’ my mind.
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says he; ‘the lad’s too soft. He’ve got
t’ be hardened.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Maybe,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘If anything happened,’ says he, ‘Toby
wouldn’t stand a show. The men is kind to un
now,’ says he, ‘for they doesn’t lose nothin’ by
it. If they stood t’ lose their lives, Tumm, they’d
push un out o’ the way, an’ he’d go ’ithout a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
whimper. I got t’ talk t’ that lad for his own
good.’
</p>
<p>
“Which he done.
</p>
<p>
“‘Toby,’ says he, ‘you is much too soft. Don’t
you go an’ feel bad, now, lad, just because your
father tells you so; for ’tis not much more’n a
child you are, an’ your father’s old, an’ knows
all about life. You got t’ get hard if you wants t’
hold your own. You’re too polite. You gives
way too easy. <em>Don’t</em> give way—don’t give way
under no circumstances. In this life,’ says he,
‘’tis every man for hisself. I don’t know why
God made it that way,’ says he, ‘but He done it,
an’ we got t’ stand by. You’re young,’ says he,
‘an’ thinks the world is what you’d have it be if
you made it; but I’m old, an’ I knows that a man
can’t be polite an’ live to his prime on this coast.
Now, lad,’ says he, ‘we isn’t struck the ice yet,
but I ’low I smell it; an’ once we gets the <em>Second
t’ None</em> in the midst, ’most anything is likely t’
happen. If so be that Tommy Jump gets the
schooner in a mess you look out for yourself;
don’t think o’ nobody else, for you can’t <em>afford</em> to.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Yes, sir,’ says the boy.
</p>
<p>
“‘Mark me well, lad! I’m tellin’ you this for
your own good. You won’t get no mercy showed
you; so don’t you show mercy t’ nobody else.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
If it comes t’ your life or the other man’s, you put
<em>him</em> out o’ the way afore he has time t’ put <em>you</em>.
Don’t let un give battle. Hit un so quick as
you’re able. It’ll be harder if you waits. You
don’t have t’ be <em>fair</em>. ’Tisn’t expected. Nobody’s
fair. An’—ah, now, Toby!’ says he,
puttin’ his arm over the boy’s shoulder, ‘if you
feels like givin’ way, an’ lettin’ the other man
have your chance, an’ if you <em>can’t</em> think o’ yourself,
just you think o’ your mother. Ah, lad,’
says he, ‘she’d go an’ cry her eyes out if anything
happened t’ you. Why, Toby—oh, my! now,
lad—why, <em>think</em> o’ the way she’d sit in her rockin’-chair,
an’ put her pinny to her eyes, an’ cry, an’
cry! You’re the only one she’ve got, an’ she
couldn’t, lad, she <em>couldn’t</em> get along ’ithout you!
Ah, she’d cry, an’ cry, an’ cry; an’ they wouldn’t
be nothin’ in all the world t’ give her comfort!
So don’t you go an’ grieve her, Toby,’ says he,
‘by bein’ tender-hearted. Ah, now, Toby!’ says
he, ‘don’t you go an’ make your poor mother
cry!’
</p>
<p>
“‘No, sir,’ says the lad. ‘I’ll not, sir!’
</p>
<p>
“‘That’s a good boy, Toby,’ says Jowl. ‘I
’low you’ll be a man when you grow up, if your
mother doesn’t make a parson o’ you.’”
</p>
<p>
Tumm made a wry face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well,” he continued, “Tommy Jump kep’
the <em>Second t’ None</em> beatin’ hither an’ yon off the
Horse Islands for two days, expectin’ ice with
the nor’east wind. ’Twas in the days afore the
sealin’ was done in steamships from St. John’s,
an’ they was a cloud o’ sail at the selsame thing.
An’ we all put into White Bay, in the mornin’
in chase o’ the floe, an’ done a day’s work on the
swiles [seals] afore night. But nex’ day we was
jammed by the ice—the fleet o’ seventeen
schooners, cotched in the bottom o’ the bay, an’
like t’ crack our hulls if the wind held. Whatever,
the wind fell, an’ there come a time o’ calm
an’ cold, an’ we was all froze in, beyond help,
an’ could do nothin’ but wait for the ice t’ drive
out an’ go abroad, an’ leave us t’ sink or sail, as
might chance. Tommy Jump ’lowed the <em>Second
t’ None</em> would sink; said her timbers was sprung,
an’ she’d leak like a basket, an’ crush like a eggshell,
once the ice begun t’ drive an’ grind an’
rafter—leastwise, he <em>thunk</em> so, admittin’ ’twas
open t’ argument; an’ he wouldn’t go so far as t’
pledge the word of a gentleman that she <em>would</em>
sink.
</p>
<p>
“‘Whatever,’ says he, ‘we’ll stick to her an’
find out.’
</p>
<p>
“The change o’ wind come at dusk—a big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
blow from the sou’west. ’Twas beyond doubt
the ice would go t’ sea; so I tipped the wink t’
young Toby Jowl an’ told un the time was come.
</p>
<p>
“‘I’ll save my life, Tumm,’ says he, ‘if I’m able.’
</p>
<p>
“’Twas a pity! Ecod! t’ this day I ’low ’twas
a pity; ’Twas a fine, sweet lad, that Toby; but
he looked like a wolf, that night, in the light o’
the forecastle lamp, when his eyes flashed an
his upper lip stretched thin over his teeth!
</p>
<p>
“‘You better get some grub in your pocket,’
says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘I got it,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says I, ‘I ’low <em>you’ve</em> learned!
Where’d you get it?”
</p>
<p>
“‘Stole it from the cook,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Any chance for me?’
</p>
<p>
“‘If you’re lively,’ says he. ‘The cook’s a
fool.... Will it come soon, Tumm?’ says he,
with a grip on my wrist. ‘How long will it be,
eh, Tumm, afore ’tis every man for hisself?’
</p>
<p>
“Soon enough, God knowed! By midnight
the edge o’ the floe was rubbin’ Pa’tridge P’int,
an’ the ice was troubled an’ angry. In an hour
the pack had the bottom scrunched out o’ the
<em>Second t’ None</em>; an’ she was kep’ above water—listed
an’ dead—only by the jam o’ little pans
’longside. Tommy Jump ’lowed we’d strike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
the big billows o’ the open afore dawn an’ the
pack would go abroad an’ leave us t’ fill an’
sink; said <em>he</em> couldn’t do no more, an’ the crew
could take care o’ their own lives, which was
what <em>he</em> would do, whatever come of it. ’Twas
blowin’ big guns then—rippin’ in straight lines
right off from Sop’s Arm an’ all them harbors for
starved bodies an’ souls t’ the foot o’ the bay.
An’ snow come with the wind; the heavens
emptied theirselves; the air was thick an’ heavy.
Seemed t’ me the wrath o’ sea an’ sky broke loose
upon us—wind an’ ice an’ snow an’ big waves
an’ cold—all the earth contains o’ hate for men!
Skipper Tommy Jump ’lowed we’d better stick
t’ the ship so long as we was able; which was
merely his opinion, an’ if the hands had a mind
t’ choose their pans while they was plenty, they
was welcome t’ do it, an’ he wouldn’t see no man
called a fool if his fists was big enough t’ stop
it. But no man took t’ the ice at that time.
An’ the <em>Second t’ None</em> ran on with the floe, out
t’ sea, with the wind an’ snow playin’ the devil
for their own amusement, an’ the ice groanin’
its own complaint....
</p>
<p>
“Then we struck the open.”

<p>
“‘Now, lads,’ yells Tommy Jump, when he got
all hands amidships, ‘you better quit the ship.
The best time,’ says he, ‘will be when you sees
<em>me</em> go overside. But don’t get in my way. You
get your own pans. God help the man that gets
in my way!’
</p>
<p>
“Tommy Jump went overside when the ice
opened an’ the <em>Second t’ None</em> begun t’ go down
an’ the sea was spread with small pans, floatin’
free. ’Twas near dawn then. Things was gray;
an’ the shapes o’ things was strange an’ big—out
o’ size, fearsome. Dawn shot over the
sea, a wide, flat beam from the east, an’ the
shadows was big, an’ the light dim, an’ the air
full o’ whirlin’ snow; an’ men’s eyes was too
wide an’ red an’ frightened t’ look with sure
sight upon the world. An’ all the ice was in a
tumble o’ black water.... An’ the <em>Second t’
None</em> went down.... An’ I ’lowed they wasn’t
no room on my pan for nobody but me. But
I seed the shape of a man leap for my place.
An’ I cursed un, an’ bade un go farther, or I’d
drown un. An’ he leaped for the pan that lied
next, where Jowl was afloat, with no room t’
spare. An’ Jowl hit quick an’ hard. He was
waitin’, with his fists closed, when the black
shape landed; an’ he hit quick an’ hard without
lookin’.... An’ I seed the face in the water....
An’, oh, I knowed who ’twas!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Dear God!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“Jowl was now but a shape in the snow.
‘That you, Tumm?’ says he. ‘What you sayin’?’
</p>
<p>
“’ Why didn’t you take time t’ <em>look</em>?’ says I.
‘Oh, Jowl! <em>why</em> didn’t you take time?’
</p>
<p>
“‘T’ look?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Dear God!’
</p>
<p>
“‘What you sayin’ that for, Tumm?’ says he.
‘What you mean, Tumm? ... My God!’ says he,
‘what is I gone an’ done? Who <em>was</em> that, Tumm?
My God! Tell me! What is I done?’
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t find no words t’ tell un.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, make haste,’ says he, ‘afore I drifts
away!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Dear God!’ says I, ‘’twas Toby!’
</p>
<p>
“An’ he fell flat on the ice....An’ I didn’t see
Jowl no more for four year. He was settled at
Mad Tom’s Harbor then, where you seed un
t’-day; an’ his wife was dead, an’ he didn’t go
no more t’ the Labrador, nor t’ the ice, but fished
the Mad Tom grounds with hook-an’-line on
quiet days, an’ was turned timid, they said, with
fear o’ the sea....”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
The <em>Good Samaritan</em> ran softly through the
slow, sleepy sea, bound across the bay to trade
the ports of the shore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p>
“I tells you, sir,” Tumm burst out, “’tis hell.
<em>Life</em> is! Maybe not where you hails from, sir;
but ’tis on this coast. I ’low where you comes
from they don’t take lives t’ save their own?”
</p>
<p>
“Not to save their own,” said I.

<p>
He did not understand.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>III—THE MINSTREL</h2>
<p>
Salim Awad, poet, was the son of Tanous—that
orator. Having now lost at love,
he lay disconsolate on his pallet in the tenement
overlooking the soap factory. He would not
answer any voice; nor would he heed the gentle
tap and call of old Khalil Khayyat, the tutor of
his muse; nor would he yield his sorrow to the
music of Nageeb Fiani, called the greatest player
in all the world. For three hours Fiani, in the
wail and sigh of his violin, had expressed the woe
of love through the key-hole; but Salim Awad
was not moved. No; the poet continued in
desolation through the darkness of that night,
and through the slow, grimy, unfeeling hours of
day. He dwelt upon Haleema, Khouri’s daughter—she
(as he thought) of the tresses of night,
the beautiful one. Salim was in despair because
this Haleema had chosen to wed Jimmie Brady,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
the truckman. She loved strength more than
the uplifted spirit; and this maidens may do, as
Salim knew, without reproach or injury.
</p>
<p>
When the dusk of the second day was gathered
in his room, Salim looked up, eased by the tender
obscurity. In the cobble-stoned street below the
clatter of traffic had subsided; there were the
shuffle and patter of feet of the low-born of his
people, the murmur of voices, soft laughter, the
plaintive cries of children—the dolorous medley
of a summer night. Beyond the fire-escape, far
past the roof of the soap factory, lifted high above
the restless Western world, was the starlit sky;
and Salim Awad, searching its uttermost depths,
remembered the words of Antar, crying in his
heart: “<em>I pass the night regarding the stars of
night in my distraction. Ask the night of me, and
it will tell thee that I am the ally of sorrow and of
anguish. I live desolate; there is no one like me.
I am the friend of grief and of desire.</em>”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
The band was playing in Battery Park; the
weird music of it, harsh, incomprehensible, an
alien love-song—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hello,&nbsp;&nbsp;mah&nbsp;&nbsp;baby,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,&nbsp;&nbsp;mah&nbsp;&nbsp;honey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello,&nbsp;&nbsp;mah&nbsp;&nbsp;rag-time&nbsp;&nbsp;girl!”<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>
drifted in at the open window with a breeze from
the sea. But by this unmeaning tumult the
soul of Salim Awad, being far removed, was not
troubled; he remembered, again, the words of
Antar, addressed to his beloved, repeating: “<em>In
thy forehead is my guide to truth; and in the night
of thy tresses I wander astray. Thy bosom is
created as an enchantment. O may God protect it
ever in that perfection! Will fortune ever, O
daughter of Malik, ever bless me with thy embrace?
That would cure my heart of the sorrows
of love.</em>”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
And again the music of the band in Battery
Park drifted up the murmuring street,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“<em>Just</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;girl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;girl!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&nbsp;&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;others,&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;know,&nbsp;&nbsp;but&nbsp;&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;my&nbsp;&nbsp;pearl.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Just</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;girl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only&nbsp;&nbsp;just&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;girl!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’d&nbsp;&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;happy&nbsp;&nbsp;forever&nbsp;&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;girl!”<br />
</p>
<p>
and came in at the open window with the idle
breeze; and Salim heard nothing of the noise,
but was grateful for the cool fingers of the wind
softly lifting the hair from his damp brow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
It must be told—and herein is a mystery—that
this same Salim, who had lost at love, now from
the darkness of his tenement room contemplating
the familiar stars, wise, remote, set in the uttermost
heights of heaven beyond the soap factory,
was by the magic of this great passion inspired
to extol the graces of his beloved Haleema,
Khouri’s daughter, star of the world, and to
celebrate his own despair, the love-woe of Salim,
the noble-born, the poet, the lover, the brokenhearted.
Without meditation, as he has said,
without brooding or design, as should occur, but
rather, taking from the starlit infinitude beyond
the soap factory, seizing from the mist of his
vision and from the blood of agony dripping from
his lacerated heart, he fashioned a love-song so
exquisite and frail, so shy of contact with unfeeling
souls, that he trembled in the presence
of this beauty, for the moment forgetting
his desolation, and conceived himself an instrument
made of men, wrought of mortal
hands, unworthy, which the fingers of angels
had touched in alleviation of the sorrows of
love.
</p>
<p>
Thereupon Salim Awad arose, and he made
haste to Khalil Khayyat to tell him of this
thing....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
This same Khalil Khayyat, lover of children,
that poet and mighty editor, the tutor of the young
muse of this Salim—this patient gardener of the
souls of men, wherein he sowed seeds of the
flowers of the spirit—this same Khalil, poet,
whose delight was in the tender bloom of sorrow
and despair—this old Khayyat, friend of Salim,
the youth, the noble-born, sat alone in the little
back room of Nageeb Fiani, the pastry-cook and
greatest player in all the world. And his narghile
was glowing; the coal was live and red, showing
as yet no gray ash, and the water bubbled
by fits and starts, and the alien room, tawdry in
its imitation of the Eastern splendor, dirty,
flaring and sputtering with gas, was clouded with
the sweet-smelling smoke. To the coffee, perfume
rising with the steam from the delicate
vessel, nor to the rattle of dice and boisterous
shouts from the outer room, was this Khalil attending;
for he had the evening dejection to
nurse. He leaned over the green baize table,
one long, lean brown hand lying upon <em>Kawkab
Elhorriah</em> of that day, as if in affectionate pity,
and his lean brown face was lifted in a rapture of
anguish to the grimy ceiling; for the dream of the
writing had failed, as all visions of beauty must
fail in the reality of them, and there had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
no divine spark in the labor of the day to set
the world aflame against Abdul-Hamid, Sultan,
slaughterer.
</p>
<p>
To him, then, at this moment of inevitable reaction,
the love-lorn Salim, entering in haste.
</p>
<p>
“Once more, Salim,” said Khalil Khayyat,
sadly, “I have failed.”
</p>
<p>
Salim softly closed the door.
</p>
<p>
“I am yet young, Salim,” the editor added,
with an absent smile, in which was no bitterness
at all, but the sweetness of long suffering. “I
am yet young,” he repeated, “for in the beginning
of my labor I hope.”
</p>
<p>
Salim turned the key.
</p>
<p>
“I am but a child,” Khalil Khayyat declared,
his voice, now lifted, betraying despair. “I
dream in letters of fire: I write in shadows. In
my heart is a flame: from the point of my pen
flows darkness. I proclaim a revolution: I hear
loud laughter and the noise of dice. Salim,” he
cried, “I am but a little child: when night falls
upon the labor of my day I remember the
morning!”
</p>
<p>
“Khalil!”
</p>
<p>
Khalil Khayyat was thrilled by the quality of
this invocation.
</p>
<p>
“Khalil of the exalted mission, friend, poet,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
teacher of the aspiring,” Salim Awad whispered,
leaning close to the ear of Khalil Khayyat, “a
great thing has come to pass.”
</p>
<p>
Khayyat commanded his ecstatic perturbation.
</p>
<p>
“Hist!” Salim ejaculated. “Is there not one
listening at the door?”
</p>
<p>
“There is no one, Salim; it is the feet of Nageeb
the coffee-boy, passing to the table of Abosamara,
the merchant.”
</p>
<p>
Salim hearkened.
</p>
<p>
“There is no one, Salim.”
</p>
<p>
“There is a breathing at the key-hole, Khalil,”
Salim protested. “This great thing must not
be known.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no one, Salim,” said Khalil Khayyat.
“I have heard Abosamara call these seven times.
Being rich, he is brutal to such as serve. The
sound is of the feet of the little Intelligent One.
He bears coffee to the impatient merchant. His
feet are soft, by my training; they pass like a
whisper.... Salim, what is this great thing?”
</p>
<p>
“Nay, but, Khalil, I hesitate: the thing must
not be heard.”
</p>
<p>
“Even so,” said Khalil Khayyat, contemptuously,
being still a poet; “the people are of the muck
of the world; they are common, they are not of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
our blood and learning. How shall they understand
that which they hear?”
</p>
<p>
“Khalil,” Salim Awad answered, reassured,
“I have known a great moment!”
</p>
<p>
“A great moment?” said Khalil Khayyat, being
both old and wise. “Then it is because of
agony. There has issued from this great pain,”
said he, edging, in his artistic excitement, toward
the victim of the muse, “a divine poem of love?”
</p>
<p>
Salim Awad sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Is it not so, Salim?”
</p>
<p>
Salim Awad flung himself upon the green
baize table; and so great was his despair that the
coffee-cup of Khalil Khayyat jumped in its saucer.
“I have suffered: I have lost at love,” he answered.
“I have been wounded; I bleed copiously.
I lie alone in a desert. My passion is hunger and
thirst and a gaping wound. From fever and the
night I cry out. Whence is my healing and satisfaction?
Nay, but, Khalil, devoted friend,”
he groaned, looking up, “I have known the ultimate
sorrow. Haleema!” cried he, rising, hands
clasped and uplifted, eyes looking far beyond the
alien, cobwebbed, blackened ceiling of the little
back room of Nageeb Fiani, the pastry-cook and
greatest player in all the world. “Haleema!” he
cried, as it may meanly be translated. “Haleema—my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
sleep and waking, night and day of my
desiring soul, my thought and heart-throb! Haleema—gone
forever from me, the poet, the unworthy,
fled to the arms of the strong, the knowing,
the manager of horses, the one powerful and
controlling! Haleema—beautiful one, fashioned
of God, star of the night of the sons of men, glory
of the universe, appealing, of the soft arms, of
the bosom of sleep! Haleema—of the finger-tips
of healing, of the warm touch of solace, of the
bed of rest! Haleema, beautiful one, beloved,
lost to me!... Haleema!... Haleema!...”
</p>
<p>
“God!” Khalil Khayyat ejaculated; “but this
is indeed great poetry!”
</p>
<p>
Salim Awad collapsed.
</p>
<p>
“And from this,” asked Khalil Khayyat, cruel
servant of art, being hopeful concerning the issue,
“there has come a great poem? There <em>must</em>,”
he muttered, “have come a love-song, a heart’s
cry in comfort of such as have lost at love.”
</p>
<p>
Salim Awad looked up from the table.
</p>
<p>
“A cry of patient anguish,” said Khalil Khayyat.
</p>
<p>
“Khalil,” said Salim Awad, solemnly, “the
strings of my soul have been touched by the hand
of the Spirit.”
</p>
<p>
“By the Spirit?”
</p>
<p>
“The fingers of Infinite Woe.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
To this Khalil Khayyat made no reply, nor
moved one muscle—save that his hand trembled
a little, and his eyes, which had been steadfastly
averted, suddenly searched the soul of Salim
Awad. It was very still in the little back room.
There was the sputtering of the gas, the tread
of soft feet passing in haste to the kitchen, the
clamor from the outer room, where common
folk were gathered for their pleasure, but no
sound, not so much as the drawing of breath, in
the little room where these poets sat, and continued
in this silence, until presently Khalil Khayyat
drew very close to Salim Awad.
</p>
<p>
“Salim,” he whispered, “reveal this poem.”
</p>
<p>
“It cannot be uttered,” said Salim Awad.
</p>
<p>
Khalil Khayyat was by this amazed. “Is it
then so great?” he asked. “Then, Salim,” said
he, “let it be as a jewel held in common by us
of all the world.”
</p>
<p>
“I am tempted!”
</p>
<p>
“I plead, Salim—I, Khalil Khayyat, the poet,
the philosopher—I plead!”
</p>
<p>
“I may not share this great poem, Khalil,”
said Salim Awad, commanding himself, “save
with such as have suffered as I have suffered.”
</p>
<p>
“Then,” answered Khalil Khayyat, triumphantly,
“the half is mine!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
“Is yours, Khalil?”
</p>
<p>
“The very half, Salim, is the inheritance of
my woe!”
</p>
<p>
“Khalil,” answered Salim Awad, rising, “attend!”
He smiled, in the way of youth upon the
aged, and put an affectionate hand on the old
man’s shoulder. “My song,” said he, passionately,
“may not be uttered; for in all the world—since
of these accidents God first made grief—there
has been no love-sorrow like my despair!”
</p>
<p>
Then, indeed, Khalil Khayyat knew that this
same Salim Awad was a worthy poet. And he
was content; for he had known a young man to
take of the woe from his own heart and fashion
a love-song too sublime for revelation to the unfeeling
world—which was surely poetry sufficient
to the day. He asked no more concerning
the song, but took counsel with Salim Awad
upon his journey to Newfoundland, whither the
young poet was going, there in trade and travel
to ease the sorrows of love. And he told him
many things about money and a pack, and how
that, though engaged in trade, a man might still
journey with poetry; the one being of place and
time and necessity, and the other of the free
and infinite soul. Concerning the words spoken
that night in farewell by these poets, not so much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
as one word is known, though many men have
greatly desired to know, believing the moment
to have been propitious for high speaking; but
not a word is to be written, not so much as a
sigh to be described, for the door was closed, and,
as it strangely chanced, there was no ear at the
key-hole. But Nageeb Fiani, the greatest player
in all the world, entering upon the departure of
Salim Awad, was addressed by Khalil Khayyat.
</p>
<p>
“Nageeb,” said this great poet, “I have seen
a minstrel go forth upon his wandering.”
</p>
<p>
“Upon what journey does the singer go, Khalil?”
</p>
<p>
“To the north, Nageeb.”
</p>
<p>
“What song, Khalil, does the man sing by the
way?”
</p>
<p>
“The song is in his heart,“ said Khalil Khayyat.
</p>
<p>
Abosamara, the merchant, being only rich,
had intruded from his own province. “Come!”
cried he, in the way of the rich who are only rich.
“Come!” cried he, “how shall a man sing with
his heart?”
</p>
<p>
Khalil Khayyat was indignant.
</p>
<p>
“Come!” Abosamara demanded, “how shall
this folly be accomplished?”
</p>
<p>
“How shall the deaf understand these things?”
answered Khalil Khayyat.
</p>
<p>
And this became a saying....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
</p>
<p>
Hapless Harbor, of the Newfoundland French
shore, gray, dispirited, chilled to its ribs of rock—circumscribed
by black sea and impenetrable
walls of mist. There was a raw wind swaggering
out of the northeast upon it: a mean, cold, wet
wind—swaggering down the complaining sea
through the fog. It had the grounds in a frothy
turmoil, the shore rocks smothered in broken
water, the spruce of the heads shivering, the
world of bleak hill and wooded valley all clammy
to the touch; and—chiefest triumph of its heartlessness—it
had the little children of the place
driven into the kitchens to restore their blue
noses and warm their cracked hands. Hapless
Harbor, then, in a nor’east blow, and a dirty day—uncivil
weather; an ugly sea, a high wind, fog
as thick as cheese, and, to top off with, a scowling
glass. Still early spring—snow in the gullies,
dripping in rivulets to the harbor water; ice at
sea, driving with the variable, evil-spirited winds;
perilous sailing and a wretched voyage of it upon
that coast. A mean season, a dirty day—a time
to be in harbor. A time most foul in feeling and
intention, an hour to lie snug in the lee of some
great rock.
</p>
<p>
The punt of Salim Awad, double-reefed in unwilling
deference to the weather, had rounded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
Greedy Head soon after dawn, blown like a
brown leaf, Salim being bound in from Catch-as-Catch-Can
with the favoring wind. It was the
third year of his wandering in quest of that ease
of the sorrows of love; and as he came into quiet
water from the toss and spray of the open, rather
than a hymn in praise of the Almighty who had
delivered him from the grasping reach of the
sea, from its cold fingers, its green, dark, swaying
grave—rather than this weakness—rather than
this Newfoundland habit of worship, he muttered,
as Antar, that great lover and warrior, had long
ago cried from his soul: “<em>Under thy veil is the
rosebud of my life, and thine eyes are guarded with
a multitude of arrows; round thy tent is a lion-warrior,
the sword’s edge, and the spear’s point</em>”—which
had nothing to do, indeed, with a nor’east
gale and the flying, biting, salty spray of a northern
sea. But this Salim had come in, having put
out from Catch-as-Catch-Can when gray light
first broke upon the black, tumultuous world,
being anxious to make Hapless Harbor as soon as
might be, as he had promised a child in the fall
of the year.
</p>
<p>
This Salim, poet, maker of the song that could
not be uttered, tied up at the stage-head of
Sam Swuth, who knew the sail of that small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
craft, and had lumbered down the hill to meet
him.
</p>
<p>
“Pup of a day,” says Sam Swuth.
</p>
<p>
By this vulgarity Salim was appalled.
</p>
<p>
“Eh?” says Sam Swuth.
</p>
<p>
Salim’s pack, stowed amidships, was neatly
and efficiently bound with tarpaulin, the infinite
mystery of which he had mastered; but his punt,
from stem to stern, swam deeply with water
gathered on the way from Catch-as-Catch-Can.
</p>
<p>
“Pup of a day,” says Sam Swuth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh my, no!” cried Salim Awad, shocked by
this inharmony with his mood. “Ver’ bad
weather.”
</p>
<p>
“Pup of a day,” Sam Swuth insisted.
</p>
<p>
“Ver’ bad day,” said Salim Awad. “Ver’
beeg wind for thee punt.”
</p>
<p>
The pack was hoisted from the boat.
</p>
<p>
“An the glass don’t lie,” Sam Swuth promised,
“they’s a sight dirtier comin’.”
</p>
<p>
Salim lifted the pack to his back. “Ver’ beeg
sea,” said he. “Ver’ bad blow.”
</p>
<p>
“Ghost Rock breakin’?”
</p>
<p>
“Ver’ bad in thee Parlor of thee Devil,” Salim
answered. “Ver’ long, black hands thee sea have.
Ver’ white finger-nail,” he laughed. “Eh? Ver’
hong-ree hands. They reach for thee punt. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
I am have escape,” he added, with a proud little
grin. “I am have escape. I—Salim! Ver’ good
sailor. Thee sea have not cotch <em>me</em>, you bet!”
</p>
<p>
“Ye’ll be lyin’ the night in Hapless?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh my, no! Ver’ poor business. I am mus’
go to thee Chain Teekle.”
</p>
<p>
Salim Awad went the round of mean white
houses, exerting himself in trade, according to
the cure prescribed for the mortal malady of
which he suffered; but as he passed from door to
door, light-hearted, dreaming of Haleema, she
of the tresses of night, wherein the souls of men
wandered astray, he still kept sharp lookout for
Jamie Tuft, the young son of Skipper Jim, whom
he had come through the wind to serve. Salim
was shy—shy as a child; more shy than ever
when bent upon some gentle deed; and Jamie
was shy, shy as lads are shy; thus no meeting
chanced until, when in the afternoon the wind
had freshened, these two blundered together in the
lee of Bishop’s Rock, where Jamie was hiding
his humiliation, grief, and small body, but devoutly
hoping, all the while, to be discovered and
relieved. It was dry in that place, and sheltered
from the wind; but between the Tickle heads,
whence the harbor opened to the sea, the gale
was to be observed at work upon the run.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
</p>
<p>
Salim stopped dead. Jamie grinned painfully
and kicked at the road.
</p>
<p>
“Hello!” cried Salim.
</p>
<p>
“’Lo, Joe!” growled Jamie.
</p>
<p>
Salim sighed. He wondered concerning the
amount Jamie had managed to gather. Would
it be sufficient to ease his conscience through the
transaction? The sum was fixed. Jamie must
have the money or go wanting. Salim feared
to ask the question.
</p>
<p>
“I isn’t got it, Joe,” said Jamie.
</p>
<p>
“Oh my! Too bad!” Salim groaned.
</p>
<p>
“Not all of un,” added Jamie.
</p>
<p>
Salim took heart; he leaned close, whispering,
in suspense: “How much have you thee got?”
</p>
<p>
“Two twenty—an’ a penny.”
</p>
<p>
“Ver’ good!” cried Salim Awad, radiant.
“Ver’, ver’ good! Look!” said he: “you have
wait three year for thee watch. Ver’ much you
have want thee watch. ‘Ha!’ I theenk; ’ver’
good boy, this—I mus’ geeve thee watch to heem.
No, no!’ I theenk; ’ver’ bad for thee boy. I mus’
not spoil thee ver’ good boy. Make thee mon-ee,’
I say; ’catch thee feesh, catch thee swile, then
thee watch have be to you!’ Ver’ good. What
happen? Second year, I have ask about the
mon-ee. Ver’ good. ‘I have got one eighteen,’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
you say. Oh my—no good! The watch have be
three dollar. Oh my! Then I theenk: ‘I have
geeve the good boy thee watch for one eighteen.
Oh no, I mus’ not!’ I theenk; ‘ver’ bad for thee
boy, an’ mos’ ver’ awful bad trade.’ Then I say,
‘I keep thee watch for one year more.’ Ver’
good. Thee third year I am have come. Ver’
good. What you say?‘ ‘I have thee two twenty-one,’
you say. Ver’, ver’ good. Thee price of
thee watch have be three dollar? No! Not
this year. Thee price have <em>not</em> be three dollar.”
</p>
<p>
Jamie looked up in hope.
</p>
<p>
“Why not?” Salim Awad continued, in delight.
“Have thee watch be spoil? No, thee watch
have be ver’ good watch. Have thee price go
down? No; thee price have not.”
</p>
<p>
Jamie waited in intense anxiety, while Salim
paused to enjoy the mystery.
</p>
<p>
“Have I then become to spoil thee boy?”
Salim demanded. “No? Ver’ good. How
then can thee price of thee watch have be two
twenty?”
</p>
<p>
Jamie could not answer.
</p>
<p>
“Ver’ good!” cried the delighted Salim. “Ver’,
ver’ good! I am have tell you. Hist!” he
whispered.
</p>
<p>
Jamie cocked his ear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hist!” said Salim Awad again.
</p>
<p>
They were alone—upon a bleak hill-side, in a
wet, driving wind.
</p>
<p>
“I have be to New York,” Salim whispered,
in a vast excitement of secrecy and delight. “I
am theenk: ‘Thee boy want thee watch. How
thee boy have thee watch? Thee good boy <em>mus’</em>
have thee watch. Oh, mygod! how?’ I theenk.
I theenk, an’ I theenk, an’ I theenk. Thee boy
mus’ pay fair price for thee watch. Ha! Thee
Salim ver’ clever. He feex thee price of thee
watch, you bet! Eh! Ver’ good. How?”
</p>
<p>
Jamie was tapped on the breast; he looked
into the Syrian’s wide, delighted, mocking brown
eyes—but could not fathom the mystery.
</p>
<p>
“How?” cried Salim. “Eh? How can the
price come down?”
</p>
<p>
Jamie shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“<em>I have smuggle thee watch!</em>” Salim whispered.
</p>
<p>
“Whew!” Jamie whistled. “That’s sinful!”
</p>
<p>
“Thee watch it have be to you,” answered
Salim, gently. “Thee sin,” he added, bowing
courteously, a hand on his heart, “it have be all
my own!”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
For a long time after Salim Awad’s departure,
Jamie Tuft sat in the lee of Bishop’s Rock—until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
indeed, the dark alien’s punt had fluttered
out to sea on the perilous run to Chain Tickle.
It began to rain in great drops; the sullen mood
of the day was about to break in some wrathful
outrage upon the coast. Gusts of wind swung
in and down upon the boy—a cold rain, a bitter,
rising wind. But Jamie still sat oblivious in the
lee of the rock. It was hard for him, unused
to gifts, through all his days unknown to favorable
changes of fortune, to overcome his astonishment—to
enter into the reality of this possession.
The like had never happened before: never before
had joy followed all in a flash upon months
of mournful expectation. He sat as still as the
passionless rock lifted behind him. It was a
tragedy of delight. Two dirty, cracked, toil-distorted
hands—two young hands, aged and
stained and malformed by labor beyond their
measure of strength and years to do—two hands
and the shining treasure within them: to these his
world was, for the time, reduced—the rest, the
harsh world of rock and rising sea and harsher
toil and deprivation, was turned to mist; it was
like a circle of fog.
</p>
<p>
Jamie looked up.
</p>
<p>
“By damn!” he thought, savagely, “’tis—’tis—<em>mine</em>!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
The character of the exclamation is to be condoned;
this sense of ownership had come like
a vision.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I <em>got</em> she!” thought Jamie.
</p>
<p>
Herein was expressed more of agonized dread,
more of the terror that accompanies great possessions,
than of delight.
</p>
<p>
“Ecod!” he muttered, ecstatically; “she’s mine—she’s mine!”
</p>
<p>
The watch was clutched in a capable fist. It
was not to be dropped, you may be sure! Jamie
looked up and down the road. There was no
highwayman, no menacing apparition of any
sort, but the fear of some ghostly ravager had
been real enough. Presently the boy laughed,
arose, moved into the path, stood close to the
verge of the steep, which fell abruptly to the
harbor water.
</p>
<p>
“I got t’ tell mamma,” he thought.
</p>
<p>
On the way to Jamie’s pocket went the watch.
</p>
<p>
“She’ll be that glad,” the boy thought, gleefully,
“that she—she—she’ll jus’ fair <em>cry</em>!”
</p>
<p>
There was some difficulty with the pocket.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” thought Jamie, grinning; “mamma’ll
jus’ cry!”
</p>
<p>
The watch slipped from Jamie’s overcautious
hand, struck the rock at his feet, bounded down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
the steep, splashed into the harbor water, and
vanished forever....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
A bad time at sea: a rising wind, spray on the
wing, sheets of cold rain—and the gray light of
day departing. Salim Awad looked back upon
the coast; he saw no waste of restless water between,
no weight and frown of cloud above, but
only the great black gates of Hapless Harbor,
beyond which, by the favor of God, he had been
privileged to leave a pearl of delight. With the
wind abeam he ran on through the sudsy sea,
muttering, within his heart, as that great Antar
long ago had cried: “<em>Were I to say thy face is
like the full moon of heaven, wherein that full
moon is the eye of the antelope? Were I to say
thy shape is like the branch of the erak tree, oh,
thou shamest it in the grace of thy form! In thy
forehead is my guide to truth, and in the night of
thy tresses I wander astray!</em>”
</p>
<p>
And presently, having won Chain Tickle, he
pulled slowly to Aunt Amelia’s wharf, where he
moored the punt, dreaming all the while of
Haleema, Khouri’s daughter, star of the world.
Before he climbed the hill to the little cottage,
ghostly in the dusk and rain, he turned again to
Hapless Harbor. The fog had been blown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
away; beyond the heads of the Tickle—far across
the angry run—the lights of Hapless were shining
cheerily.
</p>
<p>
“Ver’ good sailor—me!” thought Salim. “Ver’
good hand, you bet!”
</p>
<p>
A gust of wind swept down the Tickle and went
bounding up the hill.
</p>
<p>
“He not get me!” muttered Salim between
bared teeth.
</p>
<p>
A second gust showered the peddler with
water snatched from the harbor.
</p>
<p>
“Ver’ glad to be in,” thought Salim, with a
shudder, turning now from the black, tumultuous
prospect. “Ver’ mos’ awful glad to be in!”
</p>

<span class='caption'>THE DARK, SMILING SALIM, WITH HIS MAGIC PACK, WAS WELCOME</span>
</div>
<p>
It was cosey in Aunt Amelia’s hospitable
kitchen. The dark, smiling Salim, with his magic
pack, was welcome. The wares displayed—no
more for purchase than for the delight of inspection—Salim
stowed them away, sat himself
by the fire, gave himself to ease and comfort, to
the delight of a cigarette, and to the pleasure of
Aunt Amelia’s genial chattering. The wind beat
upon the cottage—went on, wailing, sighing, calling—and
in the lulls the breaking of the sea
interrupted the silence. An hour—two hours,
it may be—and there was the tramp of late-comers
stumbling up the hill. A loud knocking,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
then entered for entertainment three gigantic
dripping figures—men of Catch-as-Catch-Can,
bound down to Wreckers’ Cove for a doctor, but
now put in for shelter, having abandoned hope
of winning farther through the gale that night.
Need o’ haste? Ay; but what could men do?
No time t’ take a skiff t’ Wreckers’ Cove in a
wind like this! ’Twould blow your hair off
beyond the Tickle heads. Hard enough crossin’
the run from Hapless Harbor. An’ was there a
cup o’ tea an’ a bed for the crew o’ them? They’d
be under way by dawn if the wind fell. Ol’
Tom Luther had t’ have a doctor <em>somehow</em>, whatever
come of it!
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Joe!” cried the one.
</p>
<p>
Salim rose and bowed.
</p>
<p>
“Heared tell ’t Hapless Harbor you was here-abouts.”
</p>
<p>
“Much ’bliged,” Salim responded, courteously,
bowing again. “Ver’ much ’bliged.”
</p>
<p>
“Heared tell you sold a watch t’ Jim Tuft’s
young one?”
</p>
<p>
“Ver’ good watch,” said Salim.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe,” was the response.
</p>
<p>
Salim blew a puff of smoke with light grace
toward the white rafters. He was quite serene;
he anticipated, now, a compliment, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
fashioning, of his inadequate English, a dignified
sentence of acknowledgment.
</p>
<p>
“Anyhow,” drawled the man from Catch-as-Catch-Can,
“she won’t go no more.”
</p>
<p>
Salim looked up bewildered.
</p>
<p>
“Overboard,” the big man explained.
</p>
<p>
“W’at!” cried Salim.
</p>
<p>
“Dropped her.”
</p>
<p>
Salim trembled. “He have—drop thee—watch?”
he demanded. “No, no!” he cried.
“The boy have not drop thee watch!”
</p>
<p>
“Twelve fathoms o’ water.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mygod! Oh, dear me!” groaned Salim
Awad. He began to pace the floor, wringing his
hands. They watched him in amazement. “Oh,
mygod! Oh, gracious! He have drop thee
watch!” he continued. “Oh, thee poor broke
heart of thee boy! Oh, my! He have work
three year for thee watch. He have want thee
watch so ver’ much. Oh, thee great grief of thee
poor boy! I am mus’ go,” said he, with resolution.
“I am mus’ go to thee Hapless at thee once.
I am mus’ cure thee broke heart of thee poor boy.
Oh, mygod! Oh, dear!” They scorned the intention,
for the recklessness of it; they bade him
listen to the wind, the rain on the roof, the growl
and thud of the breakers; they called him a loon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
for his folly. “Oh, mygod!” he replied; “you
have not understand. Thee broke heart of thee
child! Eh? W’at you know? Oh, thee ver’
awful pain of thee broke heart. Eh? I know.
I am have thee broke heart. I am have bear thee
ver’ awful bad pain.”
</p>
<p>
Aunt Amelia put a hand on Salim’s arm.
</p>
<p>
“I am mus’ go,” said the Syrian, defiantly.
</p>
<p>
“Ye’ll not!” the woman declared.
</p>
<p>
“I am mus’ go to thee child.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye’ll not lose your life, will ye?”
</p>
<p>
The men of Catch-as-Catch-Can were incapable
of a word; they were amazed beyond
speech. ’Twas a new thing in their experience.
They had put out in a gale to fetch the doctor,
all as a matter of course; but this risk to ease
mere woe—and that of a child! They were
astounded.
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes!” Salim answered. “For thee child.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye fool!”
</p>
<p>
Salim looked helplessly about. He was nonplussed.
There was no encouragement anywhere
to be descried. Moreover, he was bewildered
that they should not understand!
</p>
<p>
“For thee child—yes,” he repeated.
</p>
<p>
They did but stare.
</p>
<p>
“Thee broke heart,” he cried, “of thee li’l child!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
No response was elicited.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me!” groaned the poet. “You <em>mus’</em>
see. It is a child!”
</p>
<p>
A gust was the only answer.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, mygod!” cried Salim Awad, poet, who
had wandered astray in the tresses of night.
“Oh, dear me! Oh, gee!”
</p>
<p>
Without more persuasion, he prepared himself
for this high mission in salvation of the heart of
a child; and being no longer deterred, he put out
upon it—having no fear of the seething water,
but a great pity for the incomprehension of such
as knew it best. It was a wild night; the wind
was a vicious wind, the rain a blinding mist, the
night thick and unkind, the sea such in turmoil
as no punt could live through save by grace.
Beyond Chain Tickle, Salim Awad entered the
thick of that gale, but was not perturbed; for
he remembered, rather than recognized the
menace of the water, the words of that great
lover, Antar, warrior and lover, who, from the
sands of isolation, sang to Abla, his beloved:
“<em>The sun as it sets turns toward her and says,
Darkness obscures the land, do thou arise in my
absence. And the brilliant moon calls out to her,
Come forth, for thy face is like me when I am at
the full and in all my glory.</em>”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
The hand upon the steering-oar of this punt,
cast into an ill-tempered, cold, dreary, evil-intentioned
northern sea, was without agitation,
the hand upon the halyard was perceiving and
sure, the eye of intelligence was detached from
romance; but still the heart remembered: “<em>The
tamarisk-trees complain of her in the morn
and in the eve, and say, Away, thou waning
beauty, thou form of the laurel! She turns away
abashed, and throws aside her veil, and the roses
are scattered from her soft, fresh cheeks. Graceful
is every limb, slender her waist, love-beaming are
her glances, waving is her form. The lustre of
day sparkles from her forehead, and by the dark
shades of her curling ringlets night itself is driven
away.</em>”
</p>
<p>
The lights of Hapless Harbor dwindled; one
by one they went out, a last message of wariness;
but still there shone, bright and promising continuance,
a lamp of Greedy Head, whereon the
cottage of Skipper Jim Tuft, the father of Jamie,
was builded.
</p>
<p>
“I will have come safe,” thought Salim, “if
thee light of Jamie have burn on.”
</p>
<p>
It continued to burn.
</p>
<p>
“It is because of thee broke heart,” thought
Salim.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
The light was not put out: Salim Awad—this
child of sand and heat and poetry—made harbor
in the rocky north; and he was delighted with the
achievement. But how? I do not know. ’Twas
a marvellous thing—thus to flaunt through three
miles of wind-swept, grasping sea. A gale of
wind was blowing—a gale to compel schooners
to reef—ay, and to double reef, and to hunt
shelter like a rabbit pursued: this I have been
told, and for myself know, because I was abroad,
Cape Norman way. No Newfoundlander could
have crossed the run from Chain Tickle to Hapless
Harbor at that time; the thing is beyond dispute;
’twas a feat impossible—with wind and lop
and rain and pelting spray to fight. But this
poet, desert born and bred, won through, despite
the antagonism of all alien enemies, cold and wet
and vigorous wind: this poet won through, led
by Antar, who said: “<em>Thy bosom is created as an
enchantment. Oh, may God protect it ever in
that perfection</em>,” and by his great wish to ease
the pain of a child, and by his knowledge of
wind and sea, gained by three years of seeking
for the relief of the sorrows of love.
</p>
<p>
“Ver’ good sailor,” thought Salim Awad, as
he tied up at Sam Swuth’s wharf.
</p>
<p>
’Twas a proper estimate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
“Ver’ good,” he repeated. “Ver’ beeg good.”
</p>
<p>
Then this Salim, who had lost at love, made
haste to the cottage of Skipper Jim Tuft, wherein
was the child Jamie, who had lost the watch. He
entered abruptly from the gale—recognizing no
ceremony of knocking, as why should he? There
was discovered to him a dismal group: Skipper
Jim, Jamie’s mother, Jamie—all in the uttermost
depths. “I am come!” cried he. “I—Salim
Awad—I am come from thee sea! I am come
from thee black night—I am come wet from thee
rain—I am escape thee hands of thee sea! I am
come—I, Salim Awad, broke of thee heart!”
’Twas a surprising thing to the inmates of that
mean, hopeless place. “I am come,” Salim repeated,
posing dramatically—“I, Salim—I am
come!” ’Twas no more than amazement he
confronted. “To thee help of thee child,” he
repeated. “Eh? To thee cure of thee broke
heart.” There was no instant response. Salim
drew a new watch from his pocket. “I have
come from thee ver’ mos’ awful sea with thee new
watch. Eh? Ver’ good. I am fetch thee cure
of thee broke heart to thee poor child.” There
was no doubt about the efficacy of the cure.
’Twas a thing evident and delightful. Salim was
wet, cold, disheartened by the night and weather;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
but the response restored him. “Thee watch
an’ thee li’l’ chain, Jamie,” said he, with a bow
most polite, “it is to you.”
</p>
<p>
Jamie grabbed the watch.
</p>
<p>
“Ver’ much ’bliged,” said Salim.
</p>
<p>
“Thanks,” said Jamie.
</p>
<p>
And in this cheap and simple way Salim Awad
restored the soul of Jamie Tuft and brought happiness
to all that household.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
And now, when the news of this feat came to
the ears of Khalil Khayyat, the editor, as all news
must come, he sought the little back room of
Nageeb Fiani, the greatest player in all the world,
with the letter in his hand. Presently he got his
narghile going, and a cup of perfumed coffee before
him on the round, green baize table; and
he was very happy—what with the narghile and
the coffee and the letter from the north. There
was hot weather, the sweat and complaint of the
tenements; there was the intermittent roar and
shriek of the Elevated trains rounding the curve
to South Ferry; there was the street murmur and
gasp, the noise of boisterous voices and the click
of dice in the outer room; but by these Khalil
Khayyat was not disturbed. Indeed not; there
was a matter of the poetry of reality occupying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
his attention. He called Nageeb, the little Intelligent
One, who came with soft feet; and he
bade the little one summon to his presence
Nageeb Fiani, the artist, the greatest player in
all the world, who came, deferentially, wondering
concerning this important message from the poet.
</p>
<p>
“Nageeb,” said Khalil Khayyat, “there has
come a letter from the north.”
</p>
<p>
Nageeb assented.
</p>
<p>
“It concerns Salim,” said Khayyat.
</p>
<p>
“What has this Salim accomplished,” asked Nageeb
Fiani, “in alleviation of the sorrows of love?”
</p>
<p>
Khayyat would not answer.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me,” Nageeb pleaded.
</p>
<p>
“This Salim,” said Khalil Khayyat, “made a
song that could not be uttered. It is well,” said
Khalil Khayyat. “You remember?”
</p>
<p>
Nageeb remembered.
</p>
<p>
“Then know this,” said Khalil Khayyat, abruptly,
“the song he could not utter he sings in
gentle deeds. It is a great song; it is too great for
singing—it must be lived. This Salim,” he added,
“is the greatest poet that ever lived. He expresses
his sublime and perfect compositions in
dear deeds. He is, indeed, a great poet.”
</p>
<p>
Nageeb Fiani thought it great argument for
poetry; so, too, Khalil Khayyat.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>IV—THE SQUALL</h2>
<p>
TUMM of the <em>Good Samaritan</em> kicked the
cabin stove into a sputter and roar of flame
so lusty that the black weather of Jump Harbor
was instantly reduced from arrogant and
disquieting menace to an impression of contrast
grateful to the heart. “Not bein’ a parson,”
said he, roused now from a brooding silence by
this radiant inspiration, “I isn’t much of a hand
at accountin’ for the mysteries o’ God; an’ never
havin’ made a world, I isn’t no critic o’ creation.
Still an’ all,” he persisted, in a flash of complaint,
“it did seem t’ me, somehow, accordin’ t’ my
lights, which wasn’t trimmed at no theological
college, that the Maker o’ Archibald Shott o’
Jump Harbor hadn’t been quite kind t’ Arch.”
The man shifted his feet in impatient disdain,
then laughed—a gently contemptuous shaft,
directed at his insolence: perhaps, too, at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
ignorance. It fell to a sigh, however, which
continued expression, presently, in a glance of
poignant bewilderment. “Take un by an’ all,”
he pursued, “I was wonderful sorry for Arch.
Seemed t’ me, sir, though he bore the sign o’
the Lord’s own hand, as do us all, that he’d
but a mean lookout for gracious livin’, after
all.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Archibald Shott!
</p>
<p>
“‘Arch, b’y,’ says I, ‘you got the disposition
of a snake.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Is I?’ says he. ‘Maybe you’re right, Tumm.
I never knowed a snake in a intimate way.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You got the soul,’ said I, ‘of a ill-born
squid.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t know,’ said he; ‘never <em>seed</em> a squid’s
soul.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Your tongue,’ says I, ‘is a flame o’ fire; ’tis
a wonder t’ me she haven’t blistered your lips
long afore this.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Isn’t <em>my</em> fault,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘No?’ says I. ‘Then who’s t’ blame?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘God made me.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Anyhow,’ said I, ‘you’ve took t’ the devil’s
alterations an’ improvements like a imp t’ hell
fire.’”
</p>
<p>
Tumm dropped into an angry muse....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
We had put in from the sea off the Harborless
Shore, balked by a screaming Newfoundland
northwester, allied with fog and falling night,
from rounding Taunt Head, beyond which lay
the snug harbor and waiting fish of Candlestick
Cove. It had been labor enough, enough of
cold, of sleety wind and anxious watching, to send
the crew to berth in sleepy confusion when the
teacups were emptied. Tumm and I sat in the
companionable seclusion of the trader’s cabin,
the schooner lying at ease in the shelter of Jump
Harbor. In the pause, led by the wind from
this warmth and peace and light to the reaches of
frothy coast, I recalled the cliffs of Black Bight,
upon which, as I had been told in the gray gale
of that day, the inevitable had overtaken Archibald
Shott. They sprang clear from the breakers,
an expanse of black rock, barren as a bone, as it
seemed in the sullen light, rising to a veil of fog,
which, floating higher than our foremast, kept
their topmost places in forbidding mystery. We
had come about within stone’s-throw, so that the
bleak walls, echoing upon us, doubled the thunder
of the sea. They inclined from the water: I bore
this impression away as the schooner darted from
their proximity—an impression, too, of ledges,
crevices, broken surfaces. In that tumultuous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
commotion, perhaps, flung then against my senses,
I had small power to observe; but I fancied, I recall,
that a nimble man, pursued by fear, might
scale the Black Bight cliffs. There was imperative
need, however, of knowing the way, else there
might be neither advance nor turning back....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“Seemed t’ be made jus’ o’ leavin’s, Arch did,”
Tumm resumed, with a little twitch of scorn:
“jus’ knocked t’gether,” said he, “with scraps
an’ odds an’ ends from the loft an’ floor. But
whatever, an a man had no harsh feelin’ again’ a
body patched up out o’ the shavin’s o’ bigger folk,
a lean, long-legged, rickety sort o’ carcass, like
t’ break in the grip of a real man,” he continued,
“nor bore no grudge again’ high cheek-bones,
skimped lips, a ape’s forehead, an’ pale-green
eyes, sot close to a nose like a axe an’ pushed a
bit too far back, why, then,” he concluded, with
a largely generous wave, “they wasn’t a deal o’
fault t’ be found with the looks o’ Archibald
Shott. Wasn’t no reason ever <em>I</em> seed why Arch
shouldn’t o’ wed any maid o’ nineteen harbors
an’ lived a sober, righteous, an’ fatherly life till
the sea cotched un. But it seemed, somehow,
that Arch must fall in love with the maid o’
Jump Harbor that was promised t’ Slow Jim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
Tool—a lovely lass, sir, believe <em>me</em>: a dimpled,
rosy, towheaded, ripplin’ sort o’ maid, as soft as
feathers an’ as plump as a oyster, with a disposition
like sunshine an’—an’—well, <em>flowers</em>.
She was a wonderful dear an’ tender lass, quick
t’ smile, sir, quick as the sea in a sunlit southerly
wind, an’ quick t’ cry, too, God bless her! in
sympathy with the woes o’ folk.
</p>
<p>
“‘Arch,’ says I, wind-bound in the <em>Curly Head</em>
at Jump Harbor, ‘don’t you <em>do</em> it.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Love,’ says he, ‘is queer.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Maybe,’ says I; ‘but keep off. You go,’ says
I, ‘an’ get a maid o’ your own.’
</p>
<p>
“‘<em>Wonderful</em> queer,’ says he. ‘’Twouldn’t
s’prise me, Tumm,’ says he, ‘if a man failed in
love with a fish-hook.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says I, ‘’Lizabeth All isn’t no fish-hook.
She’ve red cheeks an’ blue eyes an’ as
soft an’ round a body as a man ever clapped eyes
on. Her hair,’ says I, ‘is a glory; an’, Arch,’
says I, ‘why, she <em>pities</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“‘True,’ says he; ‘but it falls far short.’
</p>
<p>
“‘How far?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘you left out her muscles.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Look you, Arch!’ says I; ‘you isn’t nothin’
but a mean man. They isn’t nothin’ that’s low
an’ cruel an’ irreligious that you can’t be comfortable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
shipmates with. Understand me? They
isn’t nothin’ that can’t be spoke of in the presence
o’ women an’ children that isn’t as good as a
Sunday-school treat t’ you. It doesn’t scare you
t’ know that the things o’ your delight would
ruin God’s own world an they had their way.
Understand me?’ says I, bein’ bound, now, to
make it plain. ‘An’ now,’ says I, ‘what you
got t’ give, anyhow, for the heart an’ sweet looks
o’ this maid? Is you thinkin’,’ says I, ‘that
she’ve a hankerin’ after your dried beef body an’
pill of a soul?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Never you mind,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Speak up!’ says I. ‘What you got t’ <em>trade</em>?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘I’m clever.’
</p>
<p>
“‘’Tis small cleverness t’ think,’ says I, ‘that
in these parts a ounce o’ brains is as good as a
hundredweight o’ chest an’ shoulders.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You jus’ wait an’ see,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“Seems that Jim Tool was a big man with a
curly head an’ a maid’s gray eyes. He was
wonderful solemn an’ soft an’ slow—so slow,
believe <em>me</em>, sir, that he wouldn’t quite know till
to-morrow what he found out yesterday. If
you spat in his face to-day, sir, he might drop in
any time toward the end o’ next week an’ knock
you down; but if he put it off for a fortnight,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
why, ’twouldn’t be so wonderful s’prisin’. I
’low he was troubled a deal by the world. ’Twas
all a mystery to un. He went about, sir, with
his brows drawed down an’ a look o’ wonder an’
s’prise an’ pity on his big, kind, pink-an’-white
face. He was <em>always</em> s’prised; never seemed t’
<em>expect</em> nothin’—never seemed t’ be ready. I
’low it shocked un t’ pull a fish over the side.
‘Dear man!’ says he. ‘Well, well!’ What he
done when ’Lizabeth All first kissed un ’tis past
me t’ tell. I ’low that shootin’ wouldn’t o’
shocked un more. An’ how long it took un t’
wake up an’ really feel that kiss—how many days
o’ wonder an’ s’prise an’ doubt—’twould take a
parson t’ reckon. Anyhow, she loved un: I
knows she did—she loved un, sir, because he
was big an’ kind an’ curly-headed, which was
enough for ’Lizabeth All, I ’low, an’ might be
enough for any likely maid o’ Newf’un’land.”
</p>
<p>
I dropped a birch billet in the stove.
</p>
<p>
“Anyhow,” said Tumm, moodily, “it didn’t
last long.”
</p>
<p>
The fire crackled a genial accompaniment to
the tale of Slow Jim Tool....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“Well, now,” Tumm continued, “Slow Jim
Tool an’ Archibald Shott o’ Jump Harbor was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
cast away in the <em>Dimple</em> at Creep Head o’ the
Labrador. Bein’ wrecked seamen, they come
up in the mail-boat; an’ it so happened, sir, that
’long about Run-by-Guess, with the fog thick,
an’ dusk near come, Archibald Short managed
t’ steal a Yankee’s gold watch an’ sink un in the
pocket o’ Slow Jim Tool. ’Twas s’prisin’ t’
Jim. Fact is, when they cotched un with the
prope’ty, sir, Jim ’lowed he never knowed when
he done it—never knowed he <em>could</em> do it.
‘Ecod!’ says he; ‘now that s’prises <em>me</em>. I mus’
o’ stole that there watch in my sleep. Well,
well!’ S’prised un a deal more, they says, when
a brass-buttoned constable come aboard at Tilt
Cove’ an’ took un in charge in the Queen’s name.
‘<em>In the Queen’s name!</em>’ says Jim. ‘What’s that?
In the Queen’s name? Dear man!’ says he;
‘but this is awful! An’ I never knows when I
done it!’ ’Twas more s’prisin’ still when they
haled un past Jump Harbor. ‘Why,’ says he, ‘I
wants t’ go home an’ see ’Lizabeth All. Why,’
says he, ‘I got t’ talk it over with ‘Lizabeth!’
‘You can’t,’ says the constable. ‘But,’ says
Jim, ‘I <em>got</em> t’. Why,’ says he, ‘I always <em>have</em>.’
‘Now,’ says the constable, ‘don’t you make no
trouble.’ So Jim was s’prised again; but when
the judge give un a year t’ repent an’ make brooms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
in chokee t’ St. John’s he was <em>so</em> s’prised, they
says, that he never come to his senses till he landed
back at Jump Harbor an’ was kissed seven
times by ’Lizabeth All in the sight o’ the folk o’
that place. An’ even after that, I’m told—ay,
through a season’s fishin’—he pondered a deal
more’n was good for un. Ashore an’ afloat,
’twas all the same. ‘Well, well!’ says he. ‘Dear
man! I wonders how I done it. Arch,’ says he,
‘you was aboard; can’t <em>you</em> throw no light?’
Arch ’lowed he might an he but tried, but
wouldn’t. ‘Might interfere,’ says he, ‘atween
you an’ ’Lizabeth.’ ‘But,’ says Jim, ‘as a
friend?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says Arch, ‘’riginal sin.’
</p>
<p>
“‘’Riginal sin!’ says Jim. ‘Dear man! but
I mus’ have got my share!’
</p>
<p>
“‘You is,’ says Arch. ‘’Tis plain in your face.
You looks low and vicious. ‘Riginal sin, Jim,’
says he, ‘marks a man.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Think so?’ says Jim. ‘I’m sorry I got it.’
</p>
<p>
“‘An’ look you!’ says Arch; ‘you better be
wonderful careful about unshippin’ wickedness
on ’Lizabeth.’
</p>
<p>
“‘On ‘Lizabeth?’ says Jim. ‘What you mean?
God knows,’ says he, ‘I’d not hurt ’Lizabeth.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Then ponder,’ says Arch. ‘’Riginal sin is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
made you a thief an’ a jailbird. Ponder, Jim—ponder!’
</p>
<p>
“Now,” cries Tumm, in an outburst of feeling,
“what you think ’Lizabeth All done?”
</p>
<p>
I was confused by the question.
</p>
<p>
“Why,” Tumm answered, “it didn’t make no
difference t’ she!”
</p>
<p>
I was not surprised.
</p>
<p>
“Not s’prised!” cries Tumm. “No,” he
snapped, indignantly, “nor neither was Slow
Jim Tool.”
</p>
<p>
Of course not!
</p>
<p>
“Nobody knows nothin’ about a woman,”
said Tumm; “least of all, the woman. An’,
anyhow,” he resumed, “’Lizabeth All didn’t
care. Why, God save you, sir!” he burst out,
“she loved the shoulders an’ soul o’ Slow Jim
Tool too much t’ care. ’Tis a woman’s way; an’
a woman’s true love so passes the knowledge o’
men that faith in God is a lesson in A B C beside
it. Well,” he continued, “sailin’ the <em>Give an’
Take</em> that fall, I was cotched in the early freeze-up,
an’ us put the winter in at Jump Harbor, with
a hold full o’ fish an’ every married man o’ the
crew in a righteous rage. An’ as for ’Lizabeth,
why, when us cleared the school-room, when ol’
Bill Bump fiddled up with the accordion ‘’Money Musk’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
an’ ‘<em>Pop</em> Goes the Weasel,’ when he
sung out, ‘Balance!’ an’ ‘H’ist her, lad!’ when
the jackets was throwed aside an’ the boots
was cast off, why, ’Lizabeth All jus’ fair <em>clinged</em>
t’ that there big, gray-eyed, pink-an’-white Slow
Jim Tool! ’Twas a pretty sight t’ watch her,
sir, plump an’ winsome an’ yellow-haired, float
like a sea-gull over the school-room floor—t’ see
her blushes an’ smiles an’ eyes o’ love. It done
me good. I ’lowed I wished I was young again—an’
big an’ slow an’ kind an’ curly-headed.
But lookin’ about, sir, it seemed t’ me, as best I
could understand, that a regiment o’ little devils
was stickin’ red-hot fish-forks into the vitals o’
Archibald Shott; an’ then I ’lowed, somehow,
that maybe I was jus’ as well off as I was. I got
a look in his eyes, sir, afore the night was done;
an’ it jus’ seemed t’ me that the Lord had give
me a peep into hell.
</p>
<p>
“’Twas more’n Archibald Shott could carry.
‘Tumm,’ says he, nex’ day, ‘I ’low I’ll move.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Where to?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘’Low I’ll jack my house down t’ the ice,’ says
he, ‘an’ haul she over t’ Deep Cove. I’ve growed
tired,’ says he, ‘o’ fishin’ Jump Harbor.’
</p>
<p>
“Well, now, they wasn’t no prayer-meetin’
held t’ keep Archibald Shott t’ Jump Harbor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
The lads o’ the place an’ the crew o’ the <em>Give
an’ Take</em> turned to an’ jerked that house across
the bay t’ Deep Cove like a gale o’ wind. They
wasn’t nothin’ left o’ Archibald Shott at Jump
Harbor but the bare spot on the rocks where the
house used t’ be. When ’twas all over with, Arch
come back t’ say good-bye; an’ he took Slow Jim
Tool t’ the hills, an’, ‘Jim,’ says he, ‘you knows
where my house used t’ be? Hist!’ says he, ‘I
wants t’ tell you: is you able t’ hold a secret?
Well,’ says he, ‘I wouldn’t go pokin’ ’round in
the dirt there. You leave that place be. They
isn’t nothin’ there that you’d like t’ have. Understand?
<em>Don’t go pokin’ ’round in the dirt
where my ol’ house was.</em> But if you does,’ says
he, ‘an’ if you finds anything you wants, why,
you can keep it, and not be obliged t’ me.’ So
Jim begun pokin’ ’round; being human, he jus’
couldn’t help it. He poked an’ poked, till they
wasn’t no sense in pokin’ no more; an’ then he
’lowed he’d give ’Lizabeth a wonderful s’prise in
the spring, no matter what it cost. ‘Archibald
Shott,’ says he, ‘is a kind man. You jus’ wait,
’Lizabeth, an’ <em>see</em>.’ And in the spring, sure
enough, off he sot for Chain Tickle, where ol’
Jonas Williams have a shop an’ a store, t’ fetch
’Lizabeth a pink ostrich feather she’d seed in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
Jonas’s trader two year afore. She ’lowed that
’twas a wonderful sight o’ money t’ lay out on a
feather, when he got back; but he says: ‘Oh no,
’Lizabeth; the money wasn’t no trouble t’ get.’
</p>
<p>
“‘No trouble?’ says she.
</p>
<p>
“‘Why, no,’ says he; ‘no trouble t’ speak of.
I jus’ sort o’ poked around an’ picked it up.’
</p>
<p>
“About a week after ’Lizabeth All had first
wore that pink feather t’ meetin’ a constable
come ashore from the mail-boat an’ tapped Slow
Jim Tool on the shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“‘What you do that for?’ says Jim.
</p>
<p>
“‘In the Queen’s name!’ says the constable.
</p>
<p>
“‘My God!’ says Jim. ‘What is I been
doin’?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Counterfeitin’,’ says the constable.
</p>
<p>
“‘Counter-fittin’!’ says Jim. ‘What’s that?’
</p>
<p>
“They says,” Tumm sighed, “that poor Jim
Tool was wonderful s’prised t’ be give two year
in chokee t’ St. John’s for passin’ lead shillin’s;
for look you! Jim didn’t <em>know</em> they was lead.”
</p>
<p>
“And Elizabeth?” I ventured.
</p>
<p>
“Up an’ died,” he drawled....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“Well, now,” Tumm proceeded, “’twas three
year later that Jim Tool an’ Archibald Shott an’
me was shipped from Twillingate aboard the <em>Billy</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
<em>Boy</em> t’ fish the Labrador below Mugford along
o’ Skipper Alex Tuttle. Jim Tool was more
slow an’ solemn an’ puzzled ’n ever I knowed
un t’ be afore; an’ he was so wonderful shy o’
Archibald Shott that Arch ’lowed he’d have the
superstitious shudders if it kep’ up much longer.
‘If he’d only talk,’ says Arch, ‘an’ not creep about
this here schooner like a deaf an’ dumb ghost!’
But Jim said nar a word; he just’ kep’ a gray eye
on Arch till Arch lost a deal more sleep ’n he got.
‘He <em>irks</em> me!’ says Arch. ‘’Tisn’t a thing a religious
man would practise; an’ I’ll <em>do</em> something,’
says he, ‘t’ stop it!’ Howbeit, things was easy
till the <em>Billy Boy</em> slipped past Mother Burke in
fair weather an’ run into a dirty gale from the
north off the upper French shore. The wind
jus’ seemed t’ sweep up all the ice they was on
the Labrador an’ jam it again’ the coast at Black
Bight. There’s where we was, sir, when things
cleaned up; gripped in the ice a hundred fathom
off the Black Bight cliffs. An’ there we stayed,
lifted from the pack, lyin’ at fearsome list, till
the wind turned westerly an’ began t’ loosen up
the ice.
</p>
<p>
“’Twas after noon of a gray day when the
<em>Billy Boy</em> dropped back in the water. They was
a bank o’ blue-black cloud hangin’ high beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
the cliffs; an’ I ’lowed t’ the skipper, when I seed
it, that ’twould blow with snow afore the day
was out.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says the skipper; ‘an’ ’twon’t be long
about it.’
</p>
<p>
“Jus’ then Slow Jim Tool knocked Archibald
Shott flat on his back. Lord, what a thump!
Looked t’ me as if Archibald Shott might be
damaged.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ecod! Jim,’ says I, ‘what you go an’ do that
for?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Why,’ says Jim, ‘he said a bad word again’
the name o’ ’Lizabeth.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Never done nothin’ o’ the kind,’ says Arch.
‘I was jus’ ’bidin’ here amidships lookin’ at the
weather.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Yes, you did, Arch,’ says Jim; ‘you done it
in the forecastle—las’ Wednesday. I heared
you as I come down the ladder.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t you knock me down again,’ says Arch.
‘That <em>hurt</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says Jim, ‘you keep your tongue off
poor ’Lizabeth.’

<p>
“By this time, sir, the lads was all come up
from the forecastle. We wasn’t much hands at
fightin’, in them days, on the Labrador craft,
bein’ all friends t’gether; an’ a little turn up on
deck sort o’ scared the crew. Made un shy, too;
they hanged about, backin’ an’ shufflin’, like
kids in a parlor, fair itchin’ along o’ awkwardness,
grinnin’ a deal wider’n was called for, but sayin’
nothin’ for fear o’ drawin’ more attention ’n
they could well dodge. Skipper Alex he laughed;
then I cackled a bit—an’ then off went the crew
in a big he-haw. I seed Archibald Shott turn
white an’ twitch-lipped, an’ I minds me now, sir,
that he fidgeted somewhat about his hip; but
bein’ all friends aboard, sir, shipped from near-by
harbors, why, it jus’ didn’t jump into my mind
that he was up t’ anything more deadly than
givin’ a hitch to his trousers. How should it?
We wasn’t <em>used</em> t’ brawls aboard the <em>Billy Boy</em>.
But whatever, Archibald Shott crep’ for’ard a
bit, till he was close ’longside, an’ then bended
down t’ do up the lashin’ of his shoe: which he
kep’ at, sir, fumblin’ like a baby, till Jim looked
off t’ the clouds risin’ over the Black Bight cliffs
an’ ’lowed ’twould snow like wool afore the hour
was over. Then, ‘Will she?’ says Arch; an’
with that he drawed his splittin’-knife an’ leaped
like a lynx on Slow Jim Tool. I seed the knife in
the air, sir—seed un come down point foremost
on Jim’s big chest—an’ heared a frosty tinkle
when the broken blade struck the deck. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
didn’t seem natural, sir; not on the deck o’ the
<em>Billy Boy</em>, where we was all friends aboard, raised
in near-by harbors.
</p>
<p>
“Anyhow, Slow Jim squealed like a pig an’
clapped a hand to his heart; an’ Arch jumped
back t’ the rail, where he stood with muscles
drawed an’ arms open for a grapple, fair drillin’
holes in Jim with his little green eyes.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ouch!’ says Jim; ‘that wasn’t <em>fair</em>, Arch!’
</p>
<p>
“Arch’s lips jus’ lifted away from his teeth in a
ghastly sort o’ grin.
</p>
<p>
“‘Eh?’ says Jim. ‘What you want t’ do a
dirty trick like that for?’
</p>
<p>
“Arch didn’t seem t’ have no answer ready:
jus’ stood there eyin’ Jim, stock still as a wooden
figger-head, ’cept that he shivered an’ gulped an’
licked his blue lips with a tongue that I ’lowed
t’ be as dry as sand-paper. Seemed t’ me, sir,
when his muscles begun t’ slack an’ his eyes t’
shift, that he was more scared ’n any decent man
ought ever t’ get. But he didn’t say nothin’; nor
no more did nobody else. Wasn’t nothin’ t’ <em>say</em>.
There we was, all friends aboard, reared in near-by
harbors. Didn’t seem natural t’ be stewin’
in a mess o’ hate like that. Look you! we <em>knowed</em>
Archibald Shott an’ Slow Jim Tool: knowed un,
stripped an’ clothed, body an’ soul, an’ <em>had</em>, sir,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
since they begun t’ toddle the roads o’ Jump
Harbor. Knowed un? Why, down along afore
the <em>Lads’ Hope</em> went ashore on the Barnyard
Islands, I slep’ along o’ Jim Tool an’ <em>poulticed
Archibald Shaft’s boils</em>! Didn’t seem t’ me, sir,
when Jim took off his jacket an’ opened his shirt
that they was anything more’n sorrow for Arch’s
temper brewin’ in his heart. Murder? Never
thunk o’ murder; wasn’t used enough t’ murder.
I ’lowed, though, that Jim didn’t like the sight
o’ the cut where the knife had broke on a rib; an’
I ’lowed he liked the feel of his blood still less, for
he got white an’ stupid an’ disgusted when his
fingers touched it, jus’ as if he might be sea-sick
any minute, an’ he shook hisself an’ coughed, sir,
jus’ like a dog eatin’ grass.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘you got a knife?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t ’low no one,’ says I, ‘t’ clean a pipe
’ith my knife.’
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says he; ‘a sheath-knife?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Left un below,’ says I. ‘What you want un
for?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Jus’ a little job,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘What <em>kind</em> of a job?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh,’ says he, ‘jus’ a little job I got t’ do!’
</p>
<p>
“Seemed nobody had a knife, so Jim Tool
fetched his own from below.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Find un?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Not my bes’ one,’ says he. ‘Jus’ my second
bes’.’
</p>
<p>
“Skipper Alex ’lowed ’twould snow like goose
feathers afore half an hour was out, but, somehow,
sir, nobody cared, though the wind was
breakin’ off shore in saucy puff’s an’ the ice pack
was goin’ abroad.
</p>
<p>
“Jim Tool feeled the edge of his knife. ‘Isn’t
my bes’ one,’ says he. ‘I got a new one somewheres.’
</p>
<p>
“I ’lowed he was a bit out o’ temper with the
knife; an’ it <em>did</em> look sort o’ foul sir, along o’
overuse an’ neglect.
</p>
<p>
“‘Greasy,’ says he, wipin’ the blade on his
boot; ‘wonderful greasy! Isn’t much use no
more. Wisht I had my bes’ one. This here,’
says he, ‘is got three big nicks. But, anyhow,
Arch,’ says he, ‘I won’t hurt you no more’n I can
help!’
</p>
<p>
“Then, sir, knife in hand an’ murder hot in
his heart, he bore down on Archibald Shott.
’Twas all over in a flash: Arch, lean an’ nimble as
a imp, leaped the rail an’ put off over the ice
toward the Black Bight cliffs, with Slow Jim
in chase. Skipper Alex whistled ‘Whew!’ an’
looked perfeckly stupid along o’ s’prise; whereon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
sir, havin’ come to his senses of a sudden, he let
out a whoop like a siren whistle an’ vaulted overside.
Then me, sir; then the whole bally crew!
In jus’ a wink ’twas follow my leader over the
pans t’ save Archibald Shott from slaughter:
scramble an’ leap, sir, slip an’ splash—across the
pans an’ over the pools an’ lanes o’ water.
</p>
<p>
“I ’low the skipper might o’ overhauled Jim
an he hadn’t missed his leap an’ gone overhead
’longside. As for me, sir, wind an’ legs denied
me.
</p>
<p>
“‘Hol’ on, Jim!’ sings I. ‘Wait for <em>me</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“But Jim wasn’t heedin’ what was behind;
I ’low, sir, what with hate an’ the rage o’ years,
he wasn’t thinkin’ o’ nothin’ ’cept t’ get a knife in
the vitals o’ Archibald Shott so deep an’ soon as
he was able. Seemed he’d do it, too, in quick
time, for jus’ that minute Archibald slipped; his
legs sailed up in the air, an’ he landed on his
shoulders an’ rolled off into the water. But God
bein’ on the watch jus’ then, sir, Jim leaped
short hisself from the pan he was on, an’ afore he
could crawl from the sea Arch was out an’ lopin’
like a hare over better goin’. Jim was too quick
for me t’ nab; I was fetched up all standin’ by
the lane he’d leaped—while he sailed on in chase
o’ Arch. An’ meantime the crew was scattered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
north an’ south, every man Jack makin’ over the
ice for the Black Bight cliffs by the course that
looked best, so that Arch was drove in on the
rocks. I ’lowed ’twould be over in a trice if
somebody didn’t leap on the back o’ Slow Jim
Tool; but in this I was mistook: for Archibald
Shott, bein’ hunted an’ scared an’ nimble, didn’t
wait at the foot o’ the cliff for Jim Tool’s greasy
knife. He shinned on up—up an’ up an’ up—higher
an’ higher—with his legs an’ arms sprawled
out an’ workin’ like a spider. Nor neither did
Jim stop short. No, sir! He slipped his knife
in his belt—an’ up shinned <em>he</em>!
</p>
<p>
“‘<em>Jim</em>, you fool!’ sings I, when I come below,
‘you come down out o’ that!’
</p>
<p>
“But Jim jus’ kep’ mountin’.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jim!’ says I. ‘You want t’ fall an’ get
hurted?’
</p>
<p>
“Up comes the skipper in a proper state o’
wrath an’ salt water. ‘Look you, Jim Tool!’
sings he; ‘you want t’ break your neck?’
</p>
<p>
“I ’lowed maybe Jim was too high up t’ hear.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says the skipper, ‘that fool will
split Archibald Shott once he gets un. You go
’round by Tatter Brook,’ says he, ‘an’ climb the
hill from behind. This foolishness is got t’ be
stopped. Goin’ easy,’ says he, ‘you’ll beat Shott
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
t’ the top o’ the cliff. He’ll be over first; let un
go. But when Tool comes,’ says he, ‘why, you
got a pair o’ arms there that can clinch a argument.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says I; ‘but what’ll come o’ Archibald?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says the skipper, ‘it looks t’ me as if
he’d be content jus’ t’ keep on goin’.’
</p>
<p>
“In this way, sir, I come t’ the top o’ the cliff.
They <em>was</em> signs o’ weather—a black sky, puffs o’
wind jumpin’ out, scattered flakes o’ snow—but
they wasn’t no sign o’ Archibald Shott. They
was quite a reach o’ brink, sir, high enough from
the shore ice t’ make a stomach squirm; an’ it
took a deal o’ peepin’ an’ stretchin’ t’ spy out
Arch an’ Jim. Then I ’lowed that Arch never
<em>would</em> get over; for I seed, sir—lyin’ there on the
edge o’ the cliff, with more head an’ shoulders
stickin’ out in space than I cares t’ dream about
o’ these quiet nights—I seed that Archibald
Shott was cotched an’ could get no further.
There he was, sir, stickin’ like plaster t’ the face
o’ the cliff, some thirty feet below, finger-nails an’
feet dug into the rock, his face like a year-old
corpse. I sung out a hearty word—though,
God knows! my heart was empty o’ cheer—an’
I heard some words rattle in Shott’s dry throat,
but couldn’t understand; an’ then, sir, overcome
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
by space an’ that face o’ fear, I rolled back on
the frozen moss, sick an’ limp. When I looked
again I seed, so far below that they looked like
fat swile on the ice, the skipper an’ the crew o’
the <em>Billy Boy</em>, starin’ up, with the floe an’ black
sea beyond, lyin’ like a steep hill under the gray
sky. Midway, swarmin’ up with cautious hands
an’ feet, come Slow Jim Tool, his face as white
an’ cold as the ice below, thin-lipped, wolf-eyed,
his heart as cruel now, sir, his slow mind as keen,
his muscles as tense an’ eager, as a brute’s on
the hunt.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jim!’ says I. ‘Oh, Jim!’
</p>
<p>
“Jim jus’ come on up.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jim!’ says I. ‘Is that <em>you</em>?’
</p>
<p>
“Seemed, sir, it jus’ <em>couldn’t</em> be. Not <em>Jim</em>!
Why, I <em>nursed</em> Jim! I tossed Jimmie Tool t’
the ceilin’ when he was a mushy infant too young
t’ do any more’n jus’ gurgle. Why, at that
minute, sir, like a dream in the gray space below,
I could see Jimmie Tool’s yellow head an’ fat
white legs an’ calico dresses, jus’ as they used
t’ be.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jim,’ says I, ‘it can’t be you. Not you,
Jim,’ says I; ‘not <em>you</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘is he stuck? Can’t he
get no farther?’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
</p>
<p>
“Jim!
</p>
<p>
“‘If he can’t,’ says he, ‘I got un! I’ll knife
un, Tumm,’ says he, ‘jus’ in a minute.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t try it,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t you fret, Tumm,’ says he. ‘Isn’t
no fear o’ <em>me</em> fallin’. <em>I’m</em> all right.’
</p>
<p>
“An’ this was Jimmie Tool! Why, sir, I
knowed Jimmie Tool when he was a lad o’
twelve. A hearty lad, sir, towheaded an’ stout
an’ strong an’ lively, with freckles on his nose, an’
a warm, kind, white-toothed little grin for such
as put a hand on his shoulder. Wasn’t nobody
ever, man, woman, or child, that touched Jimmie
Tool in kindness ’ithout bein’ loved. He jus’
couldn’t help it. You jus’ be good t’ Jimmie
Tool, you jus’ put a hand on his head an’ smile,
an’ Jimmie ’lowed they was no man like you.
‘You got a awful kind heart, lad,’ says I, when he
was twelve; ‘an’ when you grows up,’ says I,
‘I ’low the folk o’ this coast will be glad you was
born.’ An’ here was Jimmie Tool, swarmin’ up
the Black Bight cliffs, bent on the splittin’ o’
Archibald Shott, which same Archibald I had
took t’ Sunday-school, by the wee, soft hand of
un, many a time, when he was a flabby-fleshed,
chatterin’ rollypolly o’ four! Bein’ jus’ a ol’ fool,
sir—bein’ jus’ a soft ol’ fool hangin’ over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
Black Bight cliffs—I wisht, somehow, that little
Jimmie Tool had never needed t’ grow up.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jimmie,” says I, ‘what you <em>really</em> goin’ t’
do?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘jus’ a minute.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Very well,’ says I; ‘but you better leave poor
Arch alone.’
</p>
<p>
“‘How’s his grip?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘None too good,’ says I; ‘a touch would dislodge
un.’
</p>
<p>
“‘If I cotched un by the ankle, then,’ says he,
‘I ’low I could jerk un loose.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You hadn’t better <em>try</em>,’ says Arch.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jim,’ says I, ‘does you know how high up
you really is?’
</p>
<p>
“Jim jus’ reached as quick as a snake for
Archibald Shott’s foot, but come somewhat short
of a grip. ‘Shoot it!’ says he, ‘I can on’y touch
un with my finger. I’ll have t’ climb higher.’
</p>
<p>
“Up he come a inch or so.
</p>
<p>
“‘You try that again, Jim,’ says Arch, ‘an’
I’ll kick you in the head.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You can’t,’ says Jim; ‘you dassn’t move a
foot from that ledge.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Try an’ see,’ says Arch.
</p>
<p>
“‘I can see very well, Arch, b’y,’ says Jim.
‘If you wriggles a toe, you’ll fall.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then, sir, I cotched ear o’ the skipper singin’
out from below. Seemed so far down when my
eyes dropped that my fingers digged theirselves
deep in the moss and clawed around for better
grip. They isn’t no beach below, sir, nor broken
rock, as you knows; the cliffs rise from deep
water. Skipper and crew was on the ice; an’ I
seed that the wind had blowed the pans off shore.
Wind was up now: blowin’ clean t’ sea, with
flakes o’ snow swirlin’ in the lee o’ the cliff. It
fair scraped the moss I was lyin’ on. Seemed t’
me, sir, that if it blowed much higher I’d need
my toes for hangin’ on. A gust cotched off my
cap an’ swep’ it over the sea. Lord! it made me
shiver t’ watch the course o’ that ol’ cloth cap!
Blow? Oh, ay—blowin’‘! An’ I ’lowed that the
skipper was nervous in the wind. He sung out
again, waved his arms, pointed t’ the sea, an’
then ducked his head, tucked in his elbows, an’
put off for the schooner, with the crew scurryin’
like weak-flippered swile in his wake. Sort o’
made me laugh, sir; they looked so round an’
squat an’ short-legged, ’way down below, sprawlin’
over the ice in mad haste t’ board the <em>Billy
Boy</em> afore she drifted off in the gale. Laugh?
Ay, sir! I laughed. Didn’t seem t’ me, sir, that
Jim Tool really <em>meant</em> t’ kill Archibald Shott.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
Jus’ seemed, somehow, like a rough game, with
somebody like t’ get hurted if they kep’ it up.
So I laughed; but I gulped that laugh back t’
my stomach, sir, when I slapped eyes again on
Archibald Shott!
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t do that, Arch,’ says I. ‘You’ll <em>fall</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘Jim says I can’t kick un in
the head.’
</p>
<p>
“‘No more you can,’ says Jim; ‘an’ you dassn’t
try.’
</p>
<p>
“Arch was belly foremost t’ the cliff—toes on
a ledge an’ hands gripped aloft. He was able
t’ look up, but made poor work o’ lookin’ down
over his shoulder; an’ I ’lowed, him not bein’
able t’ see Jim, that the minute he reached out a
foot he’d be cotched an’ ripped from his hold, if
Jim really wanted t’ do it. Anyhow, he got his
fingers in a lower crack. ’Twas a wonderful
strain t’ put on any man’s hands an’ arms: I
could see his forearms shake along of it. But
safe at this, he loosed one foot from the ledge, let
his body sink, an’ begun t’ kick out after Jim,
jus’ feelin’ about like a blind man, with his face
jammed again’ the rock. Jus’ in a minute Jim
reached for that foot. Cotched it, too; but no
sooner did Arch feel them fingers closin’ in than
he kicked out for life an’ got loose. The wrench
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
near overset Jim. He made a quick grab for the
rock an’ got a hand there jus’ in time. Jim
laughed. It may be that he thunk Arch would
be satisfied an’ draw up t’ rest. But Arch ’lowed
for one more kick; an’ this, sir, cotched Slow Jim
Tool fair on the cheek when poor Jim wasn’t
lookin’. Must o’ hurt Jim. When his head
fell back, his face was all screwed up, jus’ like a
child’s in pain. I seed, too, that his muscles was
slack, his knees givin’ way, an’ that his right hand,
with the fingers spread out crooked, was clawin’
for a hold, ecod! out in the air, where they wasn’t
nothin’ but thin wind t’ grasp. Then I didn’t
see no more, but jus’ lied flat on the moss, my
eyes fallen shut, limp an’ sweaty o’ body, waitin’
t’ come to, as from the grip o’ the Old Hag.
</p>
<p>
“When I looked again, sir, Archibald Shott
had both feet toed back on the ledge, an’ Slow
Jim Tool, below, was still stickin’ like a barnacle
t’ the cliff.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jim,’ says I, ‘if you don’t stop this foolishness
I’ll drop a rock on you.’
</p>
<p>
“‘This won’t do,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says I; ‘it <em>won’t</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“‘I ’low, Tumm,’ says he, ‘that I better swarm
above an’ come down.’
</p>
<p>
“‘What for?’ says I.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Step on his fingers,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“Then, sir, the squall broke; a rush an’ howl
o’ northerly wind! Come like a pack o’ mad
ghosts: a break from the spruce forest—a flight
over the barren—a great leap into space. Blue-black
clouds, low an’ thick, rushin’ over the cliff,
spilt dusk an’ snow below. ’Twas as though the
Lord had cast a black blanket o’ night in haste an’
anger upon the sea. An’ I never knowed the
snow so thick afore; ’twas jus’ emptied out on the
world like bags o’ flour. Dusty, frosty snow; it
got in my eyes an’ nose an’ throat. ’Twasn’t a
minute afore sea an’ shore was wiped from sight
an’ Jim Tool an’ Archibald Shott was turned t’
black splotches in a mist. I crabbed away from
the brink. Wasn’t no sense, sir, in lyin’ there in
the push an’ tug o’ the wind. An’ I sot me down
t’ wait; an’ by-an’-by I heard a cry, a dog’s bark
o’ terror, from deep in the throat, sir, that wasn’t
no scream o’ the gale. So I crawled for’ard, on
hands an’ knees that bore me ill, t’ peer below, but
seed no form o’ flesh an’ blood, nor got a human
answer t’ my hail. I turned again t’ wait; an’
I faced inland, where was the solemn forest, far
off an’ hid in a swirl o’ snow, with but the passion
of a gale t’ bear. An’ there I stood, sir, turned
away from the rage o’ hearts that beat in breasts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
like ours, until the squall failed, an’ the snow
thinned t’ playful flakes, an’ the gray clouds,
broken above the wilderness, soaked crimson
from the sun like blood.
</p>
<p>
“’Twas Jim Tool that roused me.
</p>
<p>
“‘That you, Jim?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says he; ‘you been waitin’ here for me,
Tumm?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says I; ‘been waitin’.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Tired?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says I; ‘not tired.’
</p>
<p>
“There come then, sir, a sort o’ smile upon
him—fond an’ grateful an’ childlike. I seed it
glow in the pits where his eyes was. ‘It was
kind,’ says he, ‘t’ wait. You always <em>was</em> kind
t’ me, Tumm.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh no,’ says I; ‘not kind.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, kickin’ at a rock in the
snow, ‘I done it,’ says he, ‘by the ankle.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Then,’ says I, ‘God help you, Jim!’
</p>
<p>
“He come close t’ me, sir, jus’ like he used t’
do, when he was a lad, in trouble.
</p>
<p>
“‘Keep off, Jim!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Why so?’ says he. ‘Isn’t you goin’ t’ be
friends ’ith me any more?’
</p>
<p>
“I was afraid. ‘Keep clear!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, why so?’ says he.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘I—I—don’t know!’ says I. ‘God help us
all, I don’t <em>know</em>!’
</p>
<p>
“Then he falled prone, sir, an’ rolled over on
his back, with his arms flung out, as if now he
seed the blood on his hands; an’ he squirmed in
the snow, sir, like a worm on a hook. ‘I wisht I
hadn’t done it! Oh, dear God,’ says he, ‘<em>I
wisht I hadn’t done it!</em>’
</p>
<p>
“Ah, poor little Jimmie Tool!
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“I looked away, sir, west’ard, t’ where the sky
had broken wide its gates. Ah, the sun had
washed the crimson blood-drip from the clouds!
’Twas a flood o’ golden light. Colors o’ heaven
streamin’ through upon the world! But yet
so far away—beyond the forest, and, ay, beyond
the farther sea! Maybe, sir, while my eyes
searched the far-off sunlit spaces, that my heart
fled back t’ fields o’ time more distant still. I
remembered the lad that was Jimmie Tool.
Warm-hearted, sir, aglow with tender wishes for
the joy o’ folk; towheaded an’ stout an’ strong,
straight o’ body an’ soul, with a heart lifted high,
it seemed t’ me, from the reachin’ fingers o’ sin.
Wasn’t nobody ever, sir, that touched Jimmie
Tool in kindness ’ithout bein’ loved. ‘Ah,
Jimmie,’ says I, when I looked in his clear gray
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
eyes, ‘the world’ll be glad, some day, that you
was born. Wisht I was a lad like you,’ says I,
‘an’ not a man like me.’ An’ he’d cotch hold o’
my hand, sir, an’ say: ‘Tumm, you is wonderful
good t’ me. I ’low I’m a lucky lad,’ says he,
‘t’ have a friend like you.’ So now, sir, come
back t’ the bleak cliffs o’ Black Bight, straight
returned from the days of his childhood, with the
golden dust o’ that time fresh upon my feet, the
rosy light of it in my eyes, the breath o’ God in
my heart, I kneeled in the snow beside Jim Tool
an’ put a hand on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jimmie!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“He would not take his hands from his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“‘Hush!’ says I, for I had forgot that he was
no more a child. ‘Don’t cry!’
</p>
<p>
“He cotched my hand, sir, jus’ like he used
t’do.
</p>
<p>
“’T’ me,’ says I, ‘you’ll always be the same
little lad you used t’ be.’
</p>
<p>
“It eased un: poor little Jimmie Tool!”
</p>
<p>
Tumm’s face had not relaxed. ’Twas grim
as ever. But I saw—and turned away—that
tears were upon the seamed, bronzed cheeks. I
listened to the wind blowing over Jump Harbor,
and felt the oppression of the dark night, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
lay thick upon the roads once known to the feet
of this gray-eyed Jimmie Tool. My faith was
turned gray by the tale. “Ecod!” Tumm burst
in upon my musing, misled, perhaps, by this
ancient sorrow, “I’m glad <em>I</em> didn’t make this
damned world! An’, anyhow,” he continued,
with a snap of indignation, “what happened after
that was all done as <em>among men</em>. Wasn’t no
cryin’—least of all by Jim Tool. When the
<em>Billy Boy</em> beat back t’ pick us up, all hands turned
out t’ fish Archibald Shott from the breakers,
an’ then we stowed un away in a little place by
Tatter Brook, jus’ where the water tumbles down
the hill. Jim ’lowed he might as well be took
back an’ hanged in short order. The sooner, he
says, the better it would suit. ’Lizabeth was
dead, an’ Arch was dead, an’ he might as well
go, too. Anyhow, says he, he <em>ought</em> to. But
Skipper Alex wouldn’t hear to it. Wasn’t no
time, says he; the crew couldn’t afford to lose
the v’y’ge; an’, anyhow, says he, Jim wasn’t
in no position t’ ask favors. So ’twas late in the
fall, sir, afore Jim was give into the hands o’
the Tilt Cove constable. Then Jim an’ me an’
the skipper an’ some o’ the crew put out for St.
John’s, where Jim had what they called his trial.
An’ Jim ’lowed that if the jury could do so ’ithout
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
drivin’ theirselves, an’ would jus’ order un hanged
as soon as convenient, why, he’d be ’bliged.
An’—”
</p>
<p>
Tumm paused.
</p>
<p>
“Well?” I interrogated.
</p>
<p>
“The jury,” Tumm answered, “<em>jus’ wouldn’t
do it</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“And Jimmie?”
</p>
<p>
“Jus’ fishin’.”
</p>
<p>
Poor little Jimmie Tool!

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>V—THE FOOL OF SKELETON TICKLE</h2>
<p>
When the wheezy little mail-boat rounded
the Liar’s Tombstone—that gray, immobile
head, forever dwelling upon its forgotten tragedy—she
“opened” Skeleton Tickle; and this was
where the fool was born, and where he lived his
life, such as it was, and, in the end, gave it up in
uttermost disgust. It was a wretched Newfoundland
settlement of the remoter parts, isolated
on a stretch of naked coast, itself lying unappreciatively
snug beside sheltered water: being
but a congregation of stark white cottages and
turf huts, builded at haphazard, each aloof from
its despairing neighbor, all sticking like lean incrustations
to the bare brown hills—habitations
of men, to be sure, which elsewhere had surely
relieved the besetting dreariness with the grace
and color of life, but in this place did not move
the gray, unsmiling prospect of rock and water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
The day was clammy: a thin, pervasive fog had
drenched the whole world, now damp to the
touch, dripping to the sight; the wind, out of
temper with itself, blew cold and viciously, fretting
the sea to a swishing lop, in which the harbor
punts, anchored for the day’s fishing in the
shallows over Lost Men grounds, were tossed
and flung about in a fashion vastly nauseating
to the beholder.... Poor devils of men and
boys! Toil for them, dawn to dark; with every
reward of labor—love and all the delights of life—changed
by the unhappy lot: turned sordid,
cheerless, bestial....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“Ha!” interrupted my chance acquaintance,
leaning upon the rail with me. “I am ver’ good
business man. Eh? You not theenk?” There
was a saucy challenge in this; it left no escape
by way of bored credulity; no man of proper feeling
could accept the boast of this ingratiating,
frowsy, yellow-eyed Syrian peddler. “Ha!” he
proceeded. “You not theenk, eh? But I have
tell you—I—myself! I am thee bes’ business
man in Newf’un’lan’.” He threw back his head;
regarded me with pride and mystery, eyes half
closed. “No? Come, I tell you! I am thee
<em>mos’</em> bes’ business man in Newf’un’lan’. Eh?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
Not so? Ay, I am thee ver’ mos’ bes’ business
man in all thee worl’. I—Tanous Shiva—I—<em>I</em>!”
He struck his breast. “I have be thee man. An’
thee mos’ fool—thee mos’ beeg fool—thee mos’
fearful beeg fool in all thee worl’ leeve there.
Ay, zur; he have leeve there—dead ahead—t’
Skeleton Teekle. You not theenk? Ha! I tell
you—I tell you now—a mos’ won-dair-ful fun-ee
t’ing. You hark? Ver’ well. Ha!” he exclaimed,
clasping his hands in an ecstasy of delight.
“How you will have laugh w’en I tell!”
He sobered. “I am now,” he said, solemnly,
“be-geen. You hark?”
</p>
<p>
I nodded.
</p>
<p>
“First,” he continued, gravely important, as
one who discloses a mystery, “I am tell you thee
name of thee beeg fool. James All—his name.
Ol’ bach. Ver’ ol’ bach. Ver’ rich man. Ho!
mos’ rich. You not theenk? Ver’ well. I am
once hear tell he have seven lobster-tin full of
gold. Mygod! I am mos’ put crazy. Lobster-tin—seven!
An’ he have half-bushel of silver
dollar. How he get it? Ver’ well. His gran’-father
work ver’ hard; his father work ver’ hard;
all thee gold come to this man, an’ <em>he</em> work ver’,
ver’ hard. They work fearful—in thee gale, in
thee cold; they work, work, work, for thee gold.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
Many, many year ago, long time past, thee gold
be-geen to have save. It be-geen to have save
many year afore I am born. Eh? Fun-ee
t’ing! They work, work, work; but <em>I</em> am not
work. Oh no! I am leetle baby. They save,
save, save; but <em>I</em> am not save. Oh no! I am
foolsh boy, in Damascus. Ver’ well. By-’n’-by
I am thee growed man, an’ they have fill thee
seven lobster-tin with thee gold. For what?
Eh? I am tell you what for. Ha! I am
show you I am ver’ good business man. I am
thee ver’ mos’ bes’ business man in Newf’un’lan’.”
</p>
<p>
My glance, quick, suspicious, was not of the
kindest, and it caught his eye.
</p>
<p>
“You theenk I have get thee gold?” he asked,
archly. “You theenk I have get thee seven
lobster-tin?... Mygod!” he cried, throwing up
his hands in genuine horror. “You theenk I
have <em>steal</em> thee gold? No, no! I am ver’ hones’
business man. I say my prayer all thee nights.
I geeve nine dollar fifty to thee Orth’dox Church
in Washin’ton Street in one year. I am thee
mos’ hones’ business man in Newf’un’lan’—an’”
(significantly), “I am <em>ver’ good</em> business man.”
</p>
<p>
His eyes were guileless....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
A punt slipped past, bound out, staggering
over a rough course to Lost Men grounds. The
spray, rising like white dust, drenched the crew.
An old man held the sheet and steering-oar. In
the bow a scrawny boy bailed the shipped water—both
listless, both misshapen and ill clad. Bitter,
toilsome, precarious work, this, done by folk impoverished
in all things. Seven lobster-tins of
gold coin! Three generations of labor and cruel
adventure, in gales and frosts and famines, had
been consumed in gathering it. How much of
weariness? How much of pain? How much of
evil? How much of peril, despair, deprivation?
And it was true: this alien peddler, the on-looker,
had the while been unborn, a babe, a boy, laboring
not at all; but by chance, in the end, he had
come, covetous and sly, within reach of all the
fruit of this malforming toil....
</p>
<p>
“Look!”
</p>
<p>
I followed the lean, brown finger to a spot on a
bare hill—a sombre splash of black.
</p>
<p>
“You see? Ver’ well. One time he leeve
there—this grea’ beeg fool. His house it have
be burn down. How? Ver’ well. I tell you.
All people want thee gold. All people—all—all!
‘Ha!’ theenk a boy. ‘I mus’ have thee seven
lobster-tin of gold. I am want buy thee parasol
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
for ’Liza Hull nex’ time thee trader come. I
<em>mus’</em> have thee gold of ol’ Skip’ Jim. If I not,
then Sam Tom will have buy thee parasol from
Tanous Shiva. ’Liza Hull will have love him
an’ not me. I <em>mus’</em> have ’Liza Hull love me.
Oh,’ theenk he, ‘I <em>mus’</em> have ’Liza Hull love me!
I am not can leeve ’ithout that beeg ’Liza Hull
with thee red cheek an’ blue eye!’ (Ver’ poor
taste thee men have for thee girl in Newf’un’lan’.)
‘Ha!’ theenk he. ‘I mus’ have thee gold. I am
burn thee house an’ get thee gold. Then I have
buy thee peenk parasol from Tom Shiva.’ Fool!
Ver’ beeg fool—that boy. Burn thee house? Ver’
poor business. Mos’ poor. Burn thee house of
ol’ Skip’ Jim? Pooh!”
</p>
<p>
It seemed to me, too—so did the sly fellow
bristle and puff with contempt—that the wretched
lad’s directness of method was most reprehensible;
but I came to my senses later, and I
have ever since known that the highwayman was
in some sort a worthy fellow.
</p>
<p>
“Ver’ well. For two year I know ’bout thee
seven lobster-tin of gold, an’ for two year I make
thee great frien’ along o’ Skip’ Jim—thee greates’
frien’; thee ver’ greates’ frien’—for I am want
thee gold. Aie! I am all thee time stop with
Skip’ Jim. I am go thee church with Skip’ Jim.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
I am kneel thee prayer with Skip’ Jim. (I am
ver’ good man about thee prayer—ver’ good business
man.) Skip’ Jim he theenk me thee Jew.
Pooh! I am not care. I say, ‘Oh yess, Skip’
Jim; I am mos’ sad about what thee Jews done.
Bad Jew done that.’ ‘You good Jew, Tom,’
he say; ‘I am not hol’ you to thee ’count. Oh
no, Tom; you good Jew,’ he say. ‘You would
not do what thee bad Jews done.’ ‘Oh no, Skip’
Jim,’ I say, ‘I am ver’ good man—ver’, ver’
good man.’”
</p>
<p>
The peddler was gravely silent for a space.
</p>
<p>
“I am hones’ man,” he continued. “I am
thee mos’ hones’ business man in Newf’un’lan’.
So I mus’ have wait for thee gold. Ah,” he
sighed, “it have be <em>mos’</em> hard to wait. I am
almos’ break thee heart. But I am hones’ man—ver’,
ver’ hones’ man—an’ I <em>mus’</em> have wait.
Now I tell you what have happen: I am come
ashore one night, an’ it is thee nex’ night after
thee boy have burn thee house of Skip’ Jim for
the peenk parasol.
</p>
<p>
“‘Where Skip’ Jim house?’ I say.
</p>
<p>
“‘Burn down,’ they say.
</p>
<p>
“‘Burn down!’ I say. ‘Oh, my! ’Tis sad.
Have thee seven lobster-tin of gold be los’?’
</p>
<p>
“‘All spoil,’ they say.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am not theenk what they mean. ‘Oh,
dear!’ I say. ‘Where Skip’ Jim?’
</p>
<p>
“‘You fin’ Skip’ Jim at thee Skip’ Bill Tissol’s
house.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, my!’ I say. ‘I am mos’ sad. I am
go geeve thee pit-ee to poor Skip’ Jim.’”
</p>
<p>
The fog was fast thickening. We had come
close to Skeleton Tickle; but the downcast cottages
were more remote than they had been—infinitely
more isolated.
</p>
<p>
“Ver’ well. I am fin’ Skip’ Jim. He sit in
thee bes’ room of thee Skip’ Bill Tissol’s house.
All thee ’lone. God is good! Nobody there.
What have I see? Gold! Gold! The heap of
gold! The beeg, beeg heap of gold! I am not
can tell you!”
</p>
<p>
The man was breathing in gasps; in the pause
his jaw dropped, his yellow eyes were distended.
</p>
<p>
“Ha!” he ejaculated. “So I am thank thee
dear, good God I am not come thee too late.
Gold! Gold! The heap of gold! I am pray
ver’ hard to be good business man. I am close
thee eye an’ pray thee good God I am be ver’
good business man for one hour. ‘Jus’ one
hour, O my God!’ I pray. ‘Leave me be ver’,
ver’ good business man for jus’ one leet-tle ver’
small hour. I am geeve one hun’red fifty to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
thee Orth’dox Church in Washin’ton Street, O
my God,’ I pray, ‘if I be mos’ ver’ good business
man for thee one hour!’ An’ I shake thee
head an’ look at thee rich ol’ Skip’ Jim with
thee ver’ mos’ awful sad look I am can.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, Skip’ Jim!’ I say. ‘Fear-r-ful! How
have your house cotch thee fire?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Thee boy of Skip’ Elisha,’ he say.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, Skip’ Jim,’ I say, ‘what have you do
by thee wicked boy?’
</p>
<p>
“‘What have I do?’ he say. ‘He cannot have
mend thee bad business. What have I do? I
am not wish thee hurt to thee poor, poor boy.’
</p>
<p>
“There sit thee beeg fool—thee ver’ beeg fool—thee
mos’ fearful fool in all thee worl’. Ol’
Skip’ Jim All—thee beeg fool! There he sit,
by thee ’lone; an’ the heap of good gold is on
thee table; an’ the candle is burnin’; an’ the beeg
white wheesk-airs is ver’ white an’ mos’ awful
long; an’ thee beeg han’s is on thee gold, an’ thee
salt-sores from thee feeshin’ is on thee han’s;
an’ thee tear is in thee ol’ eyes of ol’ Skip’ Jim
All. So once more I pray thee good God to be
made ver’ good business man for thee one hour;
an’ I close thee door ver’ tight.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, Tom Shiva,’ he says, ‘I am ruin’!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ver’ sad,’ I say. ‘Oh, dear!’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>

“‘I am ruin’—ruin’!’ he say. ‘Oh, I am

</p>
<p>
“‘Ver’, ver’ sad,’ I say. ‘Oh, Skip’ Jim,’ I
say, ‘tis ver’ sad!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ruin’!’ he say. ‘I am not be rich no more.
I am ver’ poor man, Tom Shiva. I am once be
rich; but I am not be rich no more.’
</p>
<p>
“I am not know what he mean. ‘Not be
rich no more?’ I say. ‘Not be rich no more?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Look!’ he say. ‘Look, Tom Shiva! Thee
gold! Thee seven lobster-tin of gold!’
</p>
<p>
“‘I am see, Skip’ Jim,’ I say.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ah,’ he say, in thee mos’ awful, thee ver’
mos’ awful, speak, ‘it is all spoil’! It is all
spoil’! I am ruin’!’
</p>
<p>
“Then I am pray mos’ fearful hard to be ver’

Thee gold is come out of the fire. What happen?

Good gold? No, spoil’ gold! No good no

</p>
<p>
“‘Spoil’, Skip’ Jim?’ I say.
</p>
<p>
“‘All spoil’, Tom Shiva,’ he say. ‘Thee gold
no good.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ver’ sad to be ruin’,’ I say. ‘Oh, Skip’ Jim,

<p>
“‘Tom Shiva,’ he say, ‘you ver’ good man.’

<p>
“‘Buy thee gold?’ he say. ‘Oh, Tom Shiva.
All spoil’. Look! All melt. Thee gold no
good no more.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I am buy thee gold from you,’ I say, ‘Skip’
Jim, my friend.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ver’ good friend, you, Tom Shiva,’ he say;
‘ver’ good friend to me.’
</p>
<p>
“I am look at him ver’ close. I am theenk
what he will take. ‘I am geeve you,’ I say, ‘I
am geeve you,’ Skip’ Jim,’ I say—
</p>
<p>
“Then I stop.
</p>
<p>
“‘What you geeve me for thee spoil’ gold?’ he
say.
</p>
<p>
“‘I am geeve you,’ I say, ‘for thee spoil’ gold
an’ for thee half-bushel of spoil’ silver,’ I say, ‘I
am geeve you seventy-five dollar.’
</p>
<p>
“Then <em>he</em> get ver’ good business man in the eye.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh no!’ he say. ‘I am want one hundred
dollar.’
</p>
<p>
“I shake my head. ‘Oh, Skip’ Jim!’ I say.
‘Shame to have treat thee friend so! I am great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
friend to you, Skip’ Jim,’ I say. ‘But,’ I say,
‘business is business. Skip’ Jim,’ I say, ‘let us
have pray.’
</p>
<p>
“What you theenk? What you theenk this
ver’ beeg fool do? How I laugh inside! ‘Let
us have pray, Skip’ Jim,’ I say. What you
theenk he do? Eh? Not pray? Ver’ religious
man, Skip’ Jim—ver’, ver’ religious. Pray?
Oh, I know <em>him</em>. Pray? You bet he pray!
You ask Skip’ Jim to pray, an’ he pray—oh,
he pray, you bet! ‘O God,’ he pray, ‘I am ver’
much ’blige’ for Tom Shiva. I am ver’ much
’blige’ he come to Skeleton Teekle. I am ver’
much ’blige’ he have thee soft heart. I am ver’
much ’blige’ you fix thee heart to help poor ol’
Skip’ Jim. He good Jew, O God.’ (Pooh! I am
Syrian man—not Jew. But I am not tell, for
I am ver’ good business man). ‘Forgive this
poor Tom Shiva, O my dear God!’
</p>
<p>
“I get ver’ tired with thee prayin’. I am ver’
good business man. I am want thee gold.
</p>
<p>
“‘Skip’ Jim!’ I whis-pair. ‘Oh, Skip’ Jim!’
I say. ‘Thee bargain! Fix thee bargain with
thee dear God.’ My heart is ver’ mad with thee
fear. ‘Fix thee bargain with thee good God,’ I
say. ‘Oh, Skip’ Jim!’ I whis-pair. ‘Queek! I
am offer seventy-five dollar.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then he get up from thee knee. Ver’ obstinate
man—ver’, ver’ obstinate man, this ol’
Skip’ Jim. He get up from thee knee. What he
theenk? Eh? He theenk he ver’ good business
man. He theenk he beat Tom Shiva by thee sin.
Want God? Oh no! Not want God to know,
you bet!
</p>
<p>
“‘I am want one hundred dollar,’ he say, ver’
cross, ‘for thee heap of spoil’ gold an’ silver.
Thee God is bus-ee. I am do this business by
thee ’lone. Thee dear God is ver’, ver’ bus-ee
jus’ now. I am not bother him no more.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ver’ well,’ I say. ‘I am geeve you eighty.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Come,’ he say; ‘ninety will have do.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ver’ well,’ I say. ‘You are my friend. I
geeve you eighty-five.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ver’ well,’ he say. ‘I am love you ver’
much, Tom Shiva. I take it. Ver’ kind of
you, Tom Shiva, to buy all thee spoil’ gold
an’ silver. I am hope you have not lose thee
money.’
</p>
<p>
“I am ver’ hones’ business man. Eh? What
I say? I say I lose thee money? No, no! I
am thee ver’ mos’ hones’ business man in Newf’un’lan’.
I am too hones’ to say thee lie.
</p>
<p>
“‘I am take thee risk,’ I say. ‘You are my
friend, Skip’ Jim,’ I say. ‘I am take thee risk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
I am geeve you eighty-five dollar for all the
spoil’ gold an’ silver—half cash, half trade....
I am have mos’ wonderful suit clothes for ver’
cheap....’”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
And the fool of Skeleton Tickle was left with
a suit of shoddy tweed and fifty-seven dollars in
unspoiled gold and silver coin, believing that he
had overreached the peddler from Damascus
and New York, piously thanking God for the opportunity,
ascribing glory to him for the success,
content that it should be so.... And Tanous
Shiva departed by the mail-boat, as he had come,
with the seven lobster-tins of gold and the half-bushel
of silver which three generations had
labored to accumulate; and he went south to
St. John’s, where he converted the spoiled coin
into a bank credit of ten thousand dollars, content
that it should be so. And thereupon he set
out again to trade....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
The mail-boat was now riding at anchor within
the harbor of Skeleton Tickle. Rain was falling—thin,
penetrating, cold, driven by the wind.
On the bleak, wet hills, the cottages, vague in the
mist, cowered in dumb wretchedness, like men
of sodden patience who wait without hope. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
punt put out from shore—came listlessly toward
the steamer for the mail.
</p>
<p>
“Ho! Tom Timms!” the Syrian shouted.
“That you, Tom Timms? How Skip’ Jim All?
How my ol’, good friend Skip’ Jim All?”
</p>
<p>
The boat was under the quarter. Tom
Timms shipped his oars, wiped the rain from
his whiskers, then looked up—without feeling.
</p>
<p>
“Dead,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Dead!” The man turned to me. “I am
thank thee good God,” he whispered, reverently,
“that I am get thee gold in time.” He shuddered.
“O, my God!” he muttered. “What if
I have come thee too late!”
</p>
<p>
“Ay, dead,” Tom Timms repeated. “He sort
o’ went an’ jus’ died.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear! How have he come to die? Oh,
my poor friend, ol’ Skip’ Jim! How have he
come by thee death?”
</p>
<p>
“Hanged hisself.”
</p>
<p>
“Hanged hisself! Oh, dear! Why have thee
ol’ Skip’ Jim be so fearful wicked?”
</p>
<p>
It was an unhappy question.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Tom Timms answered, in a colorless
drawl, “he got a trap-leader when he found out
what you done. He just sort o’ went an’ got a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
trap-leader an’ hanged hisself in the fish-stage—when
he found out what you done.”
</p>
<p>
The Syrian glanced at me. I glanced at him.
Our eyes met; his were steady, innocent, pitiful;
my own shifted to the closing bank of gray fog.
</p>
<p>
“Business,” he sighed, “is business.”
</p>
<p>
The words repeated themselves interminably—a
monotonous dirge. Business is business....
Business is business.... Business is business....
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>VI—A COMEDY OF CANDLESTICK COVE</h2>
<p>
It was windy weather: and had been—for an
exasperating tale of dusks and dawns. It
was not the weather of variable gales, which
blow here and there, forever to the advantage of
some Newfoundland folk; it was the weather of
ill easterly winds, in gloomy conjunction bringing
fog, rain, breaking seas, drift-ice, dispiriting
cold. From Nanny’s Old Head the outlook was
perturbing: the sky was hid, with its familiar
warnings and promises; gigantic breakers fell
with swish and thud upon the black rocks below,
flinging lustreless white froth into the gray mist;
and the grounds, where the men of Candlestick
Cove must cast lines and haul traps, were in an
ill-tempered, white-capped tumble—black waves
rolling out of a melancholy fog, hanging low,
which curtained the sea beyond.
</p>
<p>
The hands of the men of Candlestick Cove
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
were raw with salt-water sores; all charms against
the affliction of toil in easterly gales had failed—brass
bracelets and incantations alike. And
the eyes of the men of Candlestick Cove were
alert with apprehensive caution: tense, quick to
move, clear and hard under drawn brows. With
a high sea perversely continuing beyond the
harbor tickle, there was no place in the eyes of
men for the light of humor or love, which thrive
in security. Windy weather, indeed! ’Twas a
time for men to <em>be</em> men!
</p>
<p>
“I ’low I never seed nothin’ <em>like</em> it,” Jonathan
Stock complained.
</p>
<p>
The sea, breaking upon the Rock o’ Wishes,
and the wind, roaring past, confused old Tom Lull.
</p>
<p>
“What say?” he shouted.
</p>
<p>
“Nothin’ <em>like</em> it,” said Jonathan Stock.
</p>
<p>
They had come in from the sea with empty
punts, and they were now pulling up the harbor,
side by side, toward the stage-heads, which were
lost in the misty dusk. Old Tom had hung in
the lee of the Rock o’ Wishes until Jonathan
Stock came flying over the tickle breaker in a
cloud of spray. The wind had been in the east
beyond the experience of eighty years; it was in
his aged mind to exchange opinions upon the
marvel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
</p>
<p>
“Me neither,” said he.
</p>
<p>
They were drawing near Herring Point, within
the harbor, where the noise of wind and sea, in
an easterly gale, diminishes.
</p>
<p>
“I ’low I <em>never</em> seed nothin’ like it,” said
Jonathan Stock.
</p>
<p>
“Me neither, Skipper Jonathan.”
</p>
<p>
“Never <em>seed</em> nothin’ like it.”
</p>
<p>
They pulled on in silence—until the froth of
Puppy Rock was well astern.
</p>
<p>
“Me neither,” said Tom.
</p>
<p>
“<em>I</em> never seed nothin’ like it,” Jonathan
grumbled.
</p>
<p>
Old Tom wagged his head.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir!” Jonathan declared. “Never seed
<em>nothin’</em> like it.”
</p>
<p>
“Me neither.”
</p>
<p>
“Not like <em>this</em>,” said Jonathan, testily.
</p>
<p>
“Me neither,” old Tom agreed. “Not like
this. No, sir; me neither, b’y!”
</p>
<p>
’Twas a grand, companionable exchange of
ideas! A gush of talk! A whirlwind of opinion!
Both enjoyed it—were relieved by it: rid of the
gathered thought of long hours alone on the
grounds. Jonathan Stock had expressed himself
freely and at length; so, too, old Tom Lull.
’Twas heartening—this easy sociability. Tom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
Lull was glad that he had waited in the lee of
the Rock o’ Wishes; he had felt the need of conversation,
and was now gratified; so, too, Jonathan
Stock. But now, quite exhausted of ideas,
they proceeded in silence, pulling mechanically
through the dripping mist. From time to time
old Tom Lull wagged his head and darkly muttered;
but the words invariably got lost in his
mouth.
</p>
<p>
Presently both punts came to Jonathan Stock’s
stage.
</p>
<p>
“I <em>’low</em>,” Jonathan exclaimed, in parting, “I
never seed nothin’ like it!”
</p>
<p>
Old Tom lifted his oars. He drew his hand
over his wet beard. A moment he reflected—frowning
at the mist: deep in philosophical labor.
Then he turned quickly to Jonathan Stock:
turned in delight, his gray old face clear of bewilderment—turned
as if about to deliver himself
of some vast original conception, which might
leave nothing more to be said.
</p>
<p>
“Me neither!” he chuckled, as his oars struck
the water and his punt moved off into the mist.
</p>
<p>
Windy weather! Moreover, it was a lean year—the
leanest of three lean years. The flakes
were idle, unkempt, dripping the fog; the stages
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
were empty, the bins full of salt; the splitting-knives
were rusted: this though men and punts
and nets were worn out with toil. There was
no fish: wherefore, the feeling men of Candlestick
Cove kept clear of the merchant of the place,
who had outfitted them all in the spring of the
year, and was now contemplating the reckoning
at St. John’s with much terror and some ill-humor.
</p>
<p>
It was a lean year—a time of uneasy dread.
From Cape Norman to the Funks and beyond,
the clergy, acutely aware of the prospect, and
perceiving the opportunity to be even more useful,
preached from comforting texts. “The Lord
will provide” was the theme of gentle Parson
Grey of Doubled Arm; and the discourse culminated
in a passionate allusion to “Yet have I
never seen the seed of the righteous begging
bread.” Parson Stump of Burnt Harbor—a
timid little man with tender gray eyes—treated
“Your Heavenly Father feedeth them” with inspiring
faith.
</p>
<p>
By all this the apprehension of the folk was
lulled; it was admitted even by the unrighteous
that there were times when ’twas better to be
with than without the clergy. At Little Harbor
Shallow, old Skipper Job Sutler, a man lacking in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
understanding, put out no more to the grounds
off Devil-may-Care.
</p>
<p>
“Skipper Job,” the mail-boat captain warned,
“you better get out t’ the grounds in civil weather.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” quoth Job, “the Lard’ll take care o’ we!”
</p>
<p>
The captain was doubtful.
</p>
<p>
“An’, anyhow,” says Job, “if the Lard don’t,
the gov’ment’s got to!”
</p>
<p>
His youngest child died in the famine months
of the winter. But that was his fault....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Skipper Jonathan Stock was alone with the
trader in the shop of Candlestick Cove. The
squat, whitewashed building gripped a weather-beaten
point of harbor shore. It was night—a
black night, the wind blowing high, rain pattering
fretfully upon the roof. The worried little
trader—spare, gimlet-eyed, thin-whiskered, now
perched on the counter—slapped his calf with a
yardstick; the easterly gale was fast aggravating
his temper beyond control. It was bright and
warm in the shop; the birch billets spluttered
and snored in the stove, and a great lamp suspended
from the main rafter showered the shelves
and counter and greasy floor with light. Skipper
Jonathan’s clothes of moleskin steamed with the
rain and spray of the day’s toil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
</p>
<p>
“No, John,” said the trader, sharply; “she
can’t have un—it can’t be done.”
</p>
<p>
Jonathan slowly examined his wrist; the bandage
had got loose. “No?” he asked, gently, his
eyes still fixed on the salt-water sore.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
Jonathan drew a great hand over his narrow
brow, where the rain still lay in the furrows.
It passed over his beard—a gigantic beard, bushy
and flaming red. He shook the rain-drops from
his hand.
</p>
<p>
“No, Mister Totley,” he repeated, in a patient
drawl. “No—oh no.”
</p>
<p>
Totley hummed the opening bars of “Wrecked
on the Devil’s Finger.” He broke off impatiently—and
sighed.
</p>
<p>
“She <em>can’t</em>,” Jonathan mused. “No—<em>she</em>
can’t.”
</p>
<p>
The trader began to whistle, but there was no
heart in the diversion; and there was much
poignant distress in the way he drummed on
the counter.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t be carin’ so much,” Jonathan
softly persisted—“no, not so <em>much</em>, if ’twasn’t
their birthday. She told un three year ago they
could have un—when they was twelve. An’,
dear man! they’ll be twelve two weeks come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
Toosday. Dear man!” he exclaimed again, with
a fleeting little smile, “<em>how</em> the young ones
grows!”
</p>
<p>
The trader slapped his lean thigh and turned
his eyes from Jonathan’s simple face to the
rafters. Jonathan bungled with the bandage on
his wrist; but his fingers were stiff and large,
and he could not manage the thread. A gust of
wind made the roof ring with the rain.
</p>
<p>
“An’ the other little thing?” Jonathan inquired.
“Was you ’lowin’ my woman could have—the
other little thing? She’ve her heart sort o’ sot
on <em>that</em>. Sort o’ <em>sot</em> on havin’—that there little
thing.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t do it, Jonathan.”
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” Jonathan repeated, blankly. “She was
sayin’ the day ’twas sort o’ giddy of her; but she
was ’lowin’ her heart was sort o’ <em>sot</em> on havin’—that
little thing.”
</p>
<p>
Totley shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“Her heart,” Jonathan sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t do it, John.”
</p>
<p>
“Mm-m-m! No,” Jonathan muttered, scratching
his head in helplessness and bewilderment;
“he can’t give that little thing t’ the woman,
neither. Can’t give she <em>that</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Totley shook his head. It was not an agreeable duty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
thus to deny Jonathan Stock of Candlestick
Cove. It pinched the trader’s heart.
“But a must is a must!” thought he. The wind
was in the east, with no sign of change, and ’twas
late in the season; and there was no fish—<em>no
fish</em>, God help us all! There would be famine
at Candlestick Cove—<em>famine</em>, God help us all!
The folk of Candlestick Cove—Totley’s folk—must
be fed; there must be no starvation. And
the creditors at St. John’s—Totley’s creditors—were
wanting fish insistently. <em>Wanting fish</em>, God
help us! when there was no fish. There was
a great gale of ruin blowing up; there would
be an accounting to his creditors for the goods
they had given him in faith—there must be no
waste of stock, no indulgence of whims. He
must stand well. The creditors at St. John’s
must be so dealt with that the folk of Candlestick
Cove—Totley’s folk—could be fed through the
winter. ’Twas all-important that the folk should
be fed—just fed with bread and molasses and tea:
nothing more than that. Nothing more than
that, by the Lord! would go out of the store.
</p>
<p>
Jonathan pushed back his dripping cloth cap
and sighed. “’Tis fallin’ out wonderful,” he
ventured.
</p>
<p>
Totley whistled to keep his spirits up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
“Awful!” said Jonathan.
</p>
<p>
The tune continued.
</p>
<p>
“She ’lows,” Jonathan went on, “that if it
keeps on at this rate she won’t have none left by
spring. That’s what <em>she</em> ’lows will happen.”
</p>
<p>
Totley proceeded to the chorus.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir,” Jonathan pleaded; “she’ll have nar
a one!”
</p>
<p>
The trader avoided his eye.
</p>
<p>
“An’ it makes her <em>feel</em> sort o’ bad,” Jonathan
protested. “I tells her that with or without she
won’t be no different t’ me. Not t’ <em>me</em>. But
she sort o’ feels bad just the same. You sees,
sir,” he stammered, abashed, “she—she—she’s
only a woman!”
</p>
<p>
Totley jumped from the counter. “Look you
Jonathan!” said he, decisively, “she can <em>have</em>
it.”
</p>
<p>
Jonathan beamed.
</p>
<p>
“She can have what she wants for herself,
look you! but she can’t have no oil-skins for the
twins, though ’tis their birthday. ’Tis hard times,
Jonathan, with the wind glued t’ the east; an’
the twins is got t’ go wet. What kind she want?
Eh? I got two kinds in the case. I don’t recommend
neither o’ them.”
</p>
<p>
Jonathan scratched his head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, then,” said the trader, “you better
find out. If she’s goin’ t’ have it at all, she better
have the kind she hankers for.”
</p>
<p>
Jonathan agreed.
</p>
<p>
“Skipper Jonathan,” said the trader, much
distressed, “we’re so poor at Candlestick Cove
that we ought t’ be eatin’ moss. I’ll have trouble
enough, this fall, gettin’ flour from St. John’s t’
go ’round. Skipper Jonathan, if you could get
your allowance o’ flour down t’ five barrels instead
o’ six, I’d thank you. The young ones is
growin’, I knows; but—well, I’d thank you,
Jonathan, I’d thank you!”
</p>
<p>
“Mister Totley, sir,” Jonathan Stock replied,
solemnly, “I <em>will</em> get that flour down t’ five.
Don’t you fret no more about feedin’ my little
crew,” he pleaded. “’Tis kind o’ you; an’ I’m
sorry you’ve t’ fret.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Jonathan.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ ... you wouldn’t mind lashin’ this bit
o’ cotton on my wrist, would you, sir? The
sleeve o’ my jacket sort o’ chafes the sore.”
</p>
<p>
“A bad hand, Jonathan!”
</p>
<p>
“No—oh no; <em>it</em> ain’t bad. I’ve had scores of
un in my time. It don’t amount t’ nothin’. Oh
no—it ain’t what you might call <em>bad</em>!”
</p>
<p>
The wrist was bound anew. Jonathan stumbled down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
dark steps to the water-side, glad
that his wife was to have that which she so
much desired. He pushed out in the punt. She
was only a woman, he thought, with an indulgent
smile, but she <em>did</em> want—that little thing. The
wind was high—the rain sweeping out of the
east. He turned the bow of the punt toward a
point of light shining cheerily far off in the dark,
tumultuous night.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Jonathan Stock had no more than got off his
soggy boots, and washed his hands, and combed
his hair, and drawn close to the kitchen fire—while
his wife clattered over the bare floor about
the business of his comfort—when Parson Jaunt
tapped and entered: and folded his umbrella,
and wiped his face with a white handkerchief,
and jovially rubbed his hands together. This
was a hearty, stout little man, with a double chin
and a round, rosy face; with twinkling eyes; with
the jolliest little paunch in the world; dressed all
in black cloth, threadbare and shiny, powdered
with dandruff upon the shoulders; and wearing
a gigantic yellow chain hanging from pocket
to pocket of the waistcoat, and wilted collar
and cuffs, and patent-leather shoes, which were
muddy and cracked and turned up at the toes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
A hearty welcome he got; and he had them all
laughing at once—twins and all. Even the
chickens in the coop under the settee clucked, and
the kid behind the stove rapturously bleated, and
the last baby chuckled, and the dog yawned and
shook his hind quarters, joyfully awake.
</p>
<p>
’Twas always comforting to have Parson Jaunt
drop in. Wherever he went among the folk of
Candlestick Cove, in wet weather or dry, poor
times or bad, there was a revival of jollity. His
rippling person, smiling face, quick laugh, amiable
intimacy, his quips and questions, his way
with children—these made him beloved. Ay,
there was always a welcome for Parson Jaunt!
</p>
<p>
“Ha, ha! Yes,” the parson proceeded, “the
brethren will be here on the next mail-boat for
the district meeting. Ha, ha! Well, well, now!
And how’s the baby getting along, Aunt Tibbie?
Hut! you little toad; don’t you laugh at me!”
</p>
<p>
But the baby would.
</p>
<p>
“Ha-a-a, you rat! You <em>will</em> laugh, will you?
He’s a fine child, that.... And I was thinking,
Skipper Jonathan, that you and Aunt Tibbie
might manage Parson All of Satan’s Trap.
Times are hard, of course; but it’s the Lord’s
work, you know.... Eh? Get out, you squid!
Stop that laughing!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
The baby could not.
</p>
<p>
“Stop it, I say!”
</p>
<p>
The baby doubled up, and squirmed, and
wiggled his toes, and gasped with glee.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” the parson continued, “that you might
manage Parson All of Satan’s Trap.”
</p>
<p>
“T’ be sure!” cried Skipper Jonathan. “We’ll
manage un, an’ be glad!”
</p>
<p>
Aunt Tibbie’s face fell.
</p>
<p>
“That’s good,” said the parson. “Now, that
<em>is</em> good news. ’Tis most kind of you, too,” he
added, earnestly, “in these hard times. And
it ends my anxiety. The brethren are now all
provided for.... Hey, you wriggler! Come out
of that! Ha, ha! Well, well!” He took the
baby from the cradle. “Gi’ me a kiss, now.
Hut! You won’t? Oh, you <em>will</em>, will you?”
He kissed the baby with real delight. “I thought
so. Ha! I thought so.” He put the baby
back. “You little slobbery squid!” said he,
with a last poke. “Ha! you little squid!”
</p>
<p>
Aunt Tibbie’s face was beaming. Anxiety
and weariness were for the moment both forgot.
’Twas good, indeed, to have Parson Jaunt drop in!
</p>
<p>
“Eh, woman?” Jonathan inquired.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, ay!” she answered. “We’ve always a
pillow an’ a bite t’ eat for the Lard’s anointed.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
</p>
<p>
“The Lord’s anointed!” the parson repeated,
quickly. “Ah, that’s it, sister,” said he, the
twinkle gone from his upturned eyes. “I’ve
a notion to take that up next Sunday. And
Parson All,” he continued, “is a saintly fellow.
Yes, indeed! Converted at the age of seven.
He’s served the Lord these forty years. Ah, dear
me! what a profitable season you’ll be having
with him! A time of uplifting, a time of—of—yes,
indeed!—uplifting.” The parson was not
clever; he was somewhat limited as to ideas, as
to words; indeed, ’twas said he stuttered overmuch
in preaching and was given to repetition.
But he was sincere in the practise of his profession,
conceiving it a holy calling; and he did the best
he could, than which no man can do more. “A
time,” he repeated, “of—of—yes—of uplifting.”
</p>
<p>
Aunt Tibbie was taken by an anxious thought.
“What do he fancy,” she asked, “for feedin’?”
</p>
<p>
“Ha, ha!” the parson exploded, in his delightfully
jocular way. “That’s the woman of it.
Well, well, now! Yes, indeed! There speaks
the good housewife. Eh, Skipper Jonathan?
<em>You’re</em> well looked after, I’ll warrant. That’s
rather good, you know, coming from you, Aunt
Tibbie. Ha, ha! Why, Aunt Tibbie, he eats
anything. Anything at all! You’ll want very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
little extra—very, very little extra. But he’ll
tell you when he comes. Don’t worry about
that. Just what you have for yourselves, you
know. If it doesn’t agree with him, he’ll ask
for what he desires.”
</p>
<p>
“Sure, <em>sir</em>!” said Skipper Jonathan, heartily.
“Just let un ask for it.”
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” Aunt Tibbie echoed, blankly; “just let
un ask for it. Sure, he can speak for hisself.”
</p>
<p>
“Of <em>course</em>!” cried the parson, jovially. “Why,
to be sure! <em>That’s</em> the hospitality for me! Nothing
formal about that. That’s just what makes
us Newfoundlanders famous for hospitality.
That’s what I <em>like</em>. ‘Just let un ask.’”
</p>
<p>
The clock struck. Skipper Jonathan turned
patiently to the dial. He must be at sea by
dawn. The gale, still blowing high, promised
heavy labor at the oars. He was depressed by
the roar and patter of the night. There came,
then, an angry gust of rain—out of harmony with
the parson’s jovial spirit: sweeping in from the
black sea where Jonathan must toil at dawn.
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” he sighed, indifferently.
</p>
<p>
Aunt Tibbie gave him an anxious glance.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed! Ha, ha!” the parson laughed.
“Let me see, now,” he rattled. “To-morrow.
Yes, yes; to-morrow <em>is</em> Tuesday. Well, now, let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
me see; yes—mm-m-m, of course, that’s right—you
will have the privilege of entertaining Brother
All for four days. I wish it was more. I wish
for your sake,” he repeated, honestly, being unaware
of the true situation in this case, “that it
<em>could</em> be more. But it can’t. I assure you, it
can’t. He <em>must</em> get the mail-boat north. Pity,”
he continued, “the brethren can’t linger. These
district meetings are so helpful, so inspiring, so
refreshing. Yes, indeed! And then the social
aspect—the relaxation, the flow of soul! We
parsons are busy men—cooped up in a study,
you know; delving in books. Our brains get
tired. Yes, indeed! They need rest.” Parson
Jaunt was quite sincere. Do not misunderstand
him. ’Twould be unkind, even, to laugh at him.
He was not clever; that is all. “Brain labor,
Skipper Jonathan,” he concluded, with an odd
touch of pomposity, “is hard labor.”
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” said Skipper Jonathan, sympathetically;
“you parsons haves wonderful hard lines. I
Wouldn’t like t’ <em>be</em> one. No, sir; not me!”
</p>
<p>
In this—in the opinion and feeling—Skipper
Jonathan was sincere. He most properly loved
Parson Jaunt, and was sorry for him, and he
must not be laughed at.
</p>
<p>
“But,” the parson argued, “we have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
district meetings—times of refreshing: when brain
meets brain, you know, and wit meets wit, and
the sparks fly. Ha, ha! Yes, indeed! The
social aspect is not to be neglected. Dear me,
no! Now, for illustration, Mrs. Jaunt is to entertain
the clergy at the parsonage on Thursday
evening. Yes, indeed! She’s planned the refreshments
already.” The parson gave Aunt
Tibbie a sly, sly glance, and burst out laughing.
“Ha, ha!” he roared. “I know what you
want. You want to know what she’s going to
have, don’t you? Woman’s curiosity, eh? Ha,
ha! Oh, you women!” Aunt Tibbie smiled.
“Well,” said the parson, importantly, “I’ll tell
you. But it’s a secret, mind you! Don’t you
tell Brother All!” Aunt Tibbie beamed. “Well,”
the parson continued, his voice falling to a whisper,
“she’s going to have a jelly-cake, and an
angel-cake, and a tin of beef.” The twins sat
up, wide-eyed with attention. “Eh? Ha, ha!”
the parson laughed. “You got that? And she’s
going to have something more.” Aunt Tibbie
leaned forward—agape, her eyes staring. The
twins were already overcome. “Yes, indeed!”
said the parson. “<em>She’s got a dozen bananas
from St. John’s!</em> Eh? Ha, ha! And she’s going
to slice ’em and put ’em in a custard. Ha, ha!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
</p>
<p>
The twins gasped.
</p>
<p>
“Ha, ha!” the parson roared.
</p>
<p>
They were all delighted—parson, skipper,
housewife, and twins. Nor in providing this
hospitality for the Black Bay clergy was the
parson in thought or deed a selfish shepherd. It
would be unkind—it would be most unfair—to
think it. He was an honest, earnest servant of
the Master he acknowledged, doing good at
Candlestick Cove, in fair and foul weather. He
lived his life as best he could—earnestly, diligently,
with pure, high purpose. But he was not
clever: that is all. ’Twould be an evil thing for
more brilliant folk (and possibly less kindly) to
scorn him.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed!” the parson laughed. “And
look here, now—why, I must be off! Where’s my
umbrella? Here it is.... <em>Will</em> you look at that
baby, Aunt Tibbie? He’s staring at me yet.
Get out, you squid! Stop that laughing. Got a
kiss for me? Oh, you <em>have</em>, have you? Then
give it to me.... A fine baby that; yes, indeed!
A fine baby.... Get out, you wriggler! Leave
your toes be. Ha-a-a! I’ll catch you—yes, I
will!... What a night it is! How the wind
blows and the rain comes down! And no
sign of fish, Skipper Jonathan? Ah, well, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
Lord will provide. Good-night. God bless
you!”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll get wonderful wet, sir,” said Aunt
Tibbie, with a little frown of anxiety.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t mind it in the least,” cried the parson.
“Not at all. I’m used to it.”
</p>
<p>
Skipper Jonathan shut the door against the
wind.
</p>
<p>
“Will it never stop blowin’!” Aunt Tibbie complained.
</p>
<p>
Outside, wind and rain had their way with the
world. Aunt Tibbie and Skipper Jonathan exchanged
glances. They were thinking of the
dawn.
</p>
<p>
“I’m wantin’ t’ go t’ bed, Tibbie,” Jonathan
sighed, “for I’m wonderful tired.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ I’m tired, too, dear,” said Aunt Tibbie,
softly. “Leave us all go t’ bed.”
</p>
<p>
They were soon sound asleep....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Parson All turned out to be a mild little old
man with spectacles. His eyes were blue—faded,
watery, shy: wherein were many flashes
of humor and kindness. His face was smooth
and colorless—almost as white as his hair, which
was also long and thin and straight. When
Jonathan came in from the sea after dark—from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
the night and wet and vast confusion of that
place—Parson All was placidly rocking by the
kitchen fire, his hands neatly folded, his trousers
drawn up, so that his ankles and calves might
warm; and the kitchen was in a joyous tumult,
with which the little old man from Satan’s Trap
was in benevolent sympathy. Jonathan had
thought to find the house solemn, the wife in a
fluster, the twins painfully washed and brushed,
the able seamen of the little crew glued to their
stools; but no! the baby was crowing in the
cradle, the twins tousled and grinning, the wife
beaming, the little crew rolling on the floor—the
whole kitchen, indeed, in a gratefully familiar
condition of chaos and glee.
</p>
<p>
At once they sat down to supper.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad t’ have you, parson,” said Jonathan,
his broad, hairy face shining with soap and delight.
“That I is. I’m <em>glad</em> t’ have you.”
</p>
<p>
The parson’s smile was winning.
</p>
<p>
“Jonathan haves a wonderful taste for company,”
Aunt Tibbie explained.
</p>
<p>
The man defended himself. “I isn’t able t’
help it,” said he. “I loves t’ feed folk. An’ I
isn’t able, an’ I never was able, an’ I never will
be able t’ help it. Here’s your brewis, sir. Eat
hearty of it. Don’t spare it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p>
“They’s more in the pot,” Aunt Tibbie put in.
</p>
<p>
The parson’s gentle eye searched the table—as
our eyes have often done. A bit of hopeful
curiosity—nothing more: a thing common to us
all, saints and sinners alike. We have all been
hungry and we have all hoped; but few of us, I
fancy, being faint of hunger—and dyspeptic—have
sat down to a bowl of brewis. ’Tis no sin,
in parson or layman, to wish for more; for the
Lord endowed them both with hunger, and cursed
many, indiscriminately, with indigestion. Small
blame, then, to the parson, who was desperately
hungry; small blame to Jonathan, who had no
more to give. There is no fault anywhere to be
descried. Ah, well! the parson’s roving eye was
disappointed, but twinkled just the same; it did
not darken—nor show ill-humor. There was a
great bowl of brewis—a mountain of it. ’Twas
eyed by the twins with delight. But there was
nothing more. The parson’s eye—the shy, blue,
twinkling eye—slyly sought the stove; but the
stove was bare. And still the mild eyes continued
full of benevolence and satisfaction. He
was a <em>man</em>—that parson!
</p>
<p>
“Windy weather,” said he, with an engaging
smile.
</p>
<p>
“Never seed nothin’ <em>like</em> it!” Jonathan declared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
The twins were by this time busy with their
forks, their eyes darting little glances at the
parson, at the parson’s overloaded plate, at the
ruin of the mountain.
</p>
<p>
“Wind in the east,” the parson remarked.
</p>
<p>
Jonathan was perturbed. “You isn’t very
hearty the night,” said he.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear me, yes!” the parson protested.
“I was just about to begin.”
</p>
<p>
The faces of the twins were by this overcast.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t spare it, parson.”
</p>
<p>
The parson gulped a mouthful with a wry
face—an obstinately wry face; he could <em>not</em>
manage to control it. He smiled at once—a
quick, sweet comprehensive little smile. It was
heroic—he was sure that it was! And it <em>was</em>!
He could do no more. ’Twas impossible to take
the brewis. A melancholy—ay, and perilous—situation
for a hungry man: an old man, and a
dyspeptic. Conceive it, if you can!
</p>
<p>
“<em>That</em> ain’t hearty,” Aunt Tibbie complained.
</p>
<p>
“To be frank,” said the parson, in great humiliation—“to
be perfectly frank, I like brewis,
but—”
</p>
<p>
The happiness faded from Aunt Tibbie’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“—I don’t find it inspiring,” the parson concluded,
in shame.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
The twins promptly took advantage of the
opportunity to pass their plates for more.
</p>
<p>
“Dyspepsey?” Aunt Tibbie inquired.
</p>
<p>
“It might be called that,” Parson All replied,
sweeping the board with a smile, but yet with a
flush of guilt and shame, “by a physician.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor man!” Aunt Tibbie signed.
</p>
<p>
There was a brief silence—expectant, but not
selfishly so, on the part of the parson; somewhat
despairing on the part of the hosts.
</p>
<p>
“Well, parson,” Skipper Jonathan said, doggedly,
“all you got t’ do is <em>ask</em> for what you
wants.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all you got t’ do,” Jonathan persisted.
</p>
<p>
“Most kind of you, sir! But—no, no!”
</p>
<p>
“Please do!” Aunt Tibbie begged.
</p>
<p>
But the parson was not to be persuaded. Not
Parson All of Satan’s Trap—a kindly, sensitive
soul! He was very hungry, to be sure, and must
go hungry to bed (it seemed); but he would not
ask for what he wanted. To-morrow? Well,
<em>something</em> had to be done. He would yield—he
<em>must</em> yield to the flesh—a little. This he did
timidly: with shame for the weakness of the
flesh. He resented the peculiarity of brewis in
his particular case. Indeed, he came near to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
rebellion against the Lord—no, not rebellion:
merely rebellious questionings. But he is to be
forgiven, surely; for he wished most earnestly
that he might eat brewis and live—just as you
and I might have done.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Parson All,” Jonathan demanded,
“you just <em>got</em> t’ tell.”
</p>
<p>
And, well, the parson admitted that a little
bread and a tin of beef—to be taken sparingly—would
be a grateful diet.
</p>
<p>
“But we’ve none!” cried Aunt Tibbie. “An’
this night you’ll starve!”
</p>
<p>
“To-night,” said the parson, gently, “my
stomach—is a bit out—anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
Presently he was shown to his bed....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“I ’low,” said Aunt Tibbie, when the parson
was stowed away and she had caught Skipper
Jonathan’s wavering eye, “he’d better have
more’n that.”
</p>
<p>
“He—he—he’ve just <em>got</em> t’ have more.”
</p>
<p>
“He’ve a weak stomach,” Aunt Tibbie apologized.
“Poor man!”
</p>
<p>
“I tells you, Tibbie,” Jonathan declared,
“them parsons haves wonderful hard times.
They isn’t able t’ get out in the air enough. Too
much book-study. Too much brain labor. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
wouldn’t change places with a parson, woman,
for all the world!”
</p>
<p>
Aunt Tibbie nodded absently.
</p>
<p>
“I ’low,” said Jonathan, “I’d better be gettin’
under way for the shop.”
</p>
<p>
The man drew on his boots and got into his
oil-skins, and had his wrists bandaged and went
out. It was a long pull to the shop; but his mind
was too full of wonder and sly devising to perceive
the labor of the way.... And the trader
was silting alone in the shop, perched on the
counter, slapping his lean calf with a yardstick,
while the rain pattered on the roof and the wind
went screaming past.
</p>
<p>
“You got a parson, Jonathan,” said he, accusingly.
“Yes, you is.”
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” Jonathan admitted, “I got one.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ that’s what brings you here.”
</p>
<p>
“It be,” Jonathan replied, defiantly.
</p>
<p>
The silence was disquieting.
</p>
<p>
“I’m ’lowin’,” Jonathan stammered, “t’—t’-t’
sort o’ get four tins o’ beef.”
</p>
<p>
The trader beat his calf.
</p>
<p>
“An’ six pound o’ butter,” said Jonathan,
“an’ some pickles.”
</p>
<p>
“Anything else?” the trader snapped.
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” said Jonathan, “they is.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
The trader sniffed.
</p>
<p>
“The parson haven’t said nothin’, but Tibbie’s
got a notion that he’s wonderful fond o’ canned
peaches,” Jonathan ventured, diffidently. “She
’lows they’ll keep his food sweet.”
</p>
<p>
“Anything else?”
</p>
<p>
“No—oh no!” Jonathan sighed. “I ’low you
wouldn’t give me three pound o’ cheese?” he
asked. “Not that the parson <em>mentioned</em> cheese,
but Tibbie ’lows he’d find it healthful.” The
trader nodded. “About four cans o’ peaches,”
said Jonathan.
</p>
<p>
“I see,” said the trader.
</p>
<p>
Jonathan drew a great hand over his narrow
brow, where the rain still lay in the furrows.
It passed over his red whiskers. He shook the
rain-drops from his hand.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!” he sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Jonathan,” said the trader, sharply, “you’re
a fool. I’ve long knowed it. But I loves a fool;
an’ you’re the biggest dunderhead I ever knowed.
You can <em>have</em> the cheese; you can <em>have</em> the beef;
you can <em>have</em> the peaches. You can have un all.
<em>But</em>—you got t’ pay.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, ay,” said Jonathan, freely. “I’ll pay!”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll go without sweetness in your tea,” the
trader burst out, “all next winter. Understand?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
No sweetness in your tea. <em>That’s</em> how you’ll
pay. If you takes these things, mark you,
Jonathan!—an’ hearken well—if you takes these
things for your parson, there’ll be no molasses
measured out for <em>you</em>. You’ll take your tea
straight. Do you understand me, Jonathan
Stock?”
</p>
<p>
“’Tis well,” said Jonathan.
</p>
<p>
“An’—”
</p>
<p>
“The other?” Jonathan interrupted, anxiously.
“You wasn’t ’lowin’ t’ have the woman give
up that, was you? ’Tis such a little thing.”
</p>
<p>
The trader was out of temper.
</p>
<p>
“Not that!” Jonathan pleaded.
</p>
<p>
“Just that!” Totley exclaimed. “I’ll not give
it to her. If you’re t’ have parsons, why, pay
for un. Don’t come askin’ me t’ do it for
you.”
</p>
<p>
“But she—she—<em>she’s only a woman</em>! An’
she sort o’ feels bad. Not that ’twould make any
difference t’ me—not t’ <em>me</em>. Oh, I tells her that.
But she ’lows she wants it, anyhow. She sort
o’ <em>hankers</em> for it. An’ if you could manage—”
</p>
<p>
“Not I!” Totley was very much out of temper.
“Pay for your own parson,” he growled.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, well,” Jonathan sighed, “she ’lowed, if
you made a p’int of it, that she’d take the grub
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
an’ do without—the other. Ay, do without—the
other.”
</p>
<p>
So Jonathan went home with what the parson
needed to eat, and he was happy.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
It was still windy weather. Dusks and dawns
came in melancholy procession. The wind swept
in the east—high, wet, cold. Fog and rain and
drift-ice were to be met on the grounds of Candlestick
Cove. From Nanny’s Old Head the outlook
was more perturbing than ever: the sea’s
distances were still hid in the mist; the breakers
on the black rocks below gave the waste a voice,
expressed its rage, its sullen purpose; the grounds
where the men of Candlestick Cove must fish
were still in a white-capped tumble; and the sores
on the wrists of the men of Candlestick Cove
were not healed. There was no fish; the coast
hopelessly faced famine; men and women and
children would all grow lean. The winter, approaching,
was like an angry cloud rising from
the rim of the sea. The faces of the men of
Candlestick Cove were drawn—with fear of the
sea and with dread of what might come to pass.
In the meeting-house of Candlestick Cove, in
district meeting assembled, the Black Bay clergy
engaged in important discussions, with which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
sea and the dripping rocks and the easterly wind
had nothing to do....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
The Black Bay parsons were exchanging farewells
at the landing-stage. The steamer was
waiting. There had been no change in the
weather: the wind was blowing high from the
east, there was fog abroad, the air was clammy.
Parson Jaunt took Parson All by the arm and
led him aside.
</p>
<p>
“How was you fixed, brother?” he whispered,
anxiously. “I haven’t had time to ask you
before.”
</p>
<p>
Parson All’s eyebrows were lifted in mild inquiry.
</p>
<p>
“Was you comfortable? Did you get enough
to eat?”
</p>
<p>
There was concern in Parson Jaunt’s voice—a
sweet, wistful consideration.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes!” Parson All answered, quickly.
“They are very good people—the Stocks.”
</p>
<p>
“They’re clean, but—”
</p>
<p>
“Poor.”
</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>
“Very, very poor! Frankly, Brother All, I was
troubled. Yes, indeed! I was troubled. I knew
they were poor, and I didn’t know whether it was
wise or right to put you there. I feared that you
might fare rather badly. But there was nothing
else to do. I sincerely hope—”
</p>
<p>
Parson All raised a hand in protest.
</p>
<p>
“You was fixed all right?” Parson Jaunt asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, brother,” answered Parson All, in genuine
appreciation of the hospitality he had received.
“It was touching. Praise the Lord! I’m glad
to know that such people <em>live</em> in a selfish world
like this. It was very, very touching.”
</p>
<p>
Parson Jaunt’s face expressed some surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Do you know what they did?” said Parson
All, taking Parson Jaunt by the lapel of the
coat and staring deep into his eyes. “<em>Do you
know what they did?</em>”
</p>
<p>
Parson Jaunt wagged his head.
</p>
<p>
“Why, brother,” Parson All declared, with
genuinely grateful tears in his eyes, “when I told
Skipper Jonathan that brewis soured on my
stomach, he got me tinned beef, and butter, and
canned peaches, and cheese. I’ll never forget
his goodness. Never!”
</p>
<p>
Parson Jaunt stared. “What a wonderful
thing Christianity is!” he exclaimed. “What a
wonderful, wonderful thing! By their fruits,”
he quoted, “ye shall know them.”
</p>
<p>
The Black Bay clergy were called aboard.
Parson Jaunt shook off the mild old Parson All
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
and rushed to the Chairman of the District, his
black coat-tails flying in the easterly wind, and
wrung the Chairman’s hand, and jovially laughed
until his jolly little paunch shook like jelly....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
That night, in the whitewashed cottage upon
which the angry gale beat, Skipper Jonathan and
Aunt Tibbie sat together by the kitchen fire.
Skipper Jonathan was hopelessly in from the
sea—from the white waves thereof, and the wind,
and the perilous night—and Aunt Tibbie had
dressed the sores on his wrists. The twins and
all the rest of the little crew were tucked away
and sound asleep.
</p>
<p>
Skipper Jonathan sighed.
</p>
<p>
“What was you thinkin’ about, Jonathan?”
Aunt Tibbie asked.
</p>
<p>
“Jus’ ponderin’,” said he.
</p>
<p>
“Ay; but what upon?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Tibbie,” Jonathan answered, in embarrassment,
“I was jus’—ponderin’.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Jonathan?”
</p>
<p>
“I was ’lowin’, Tibbie,” Jonathan admitted,
“that it wouldn’t be so easy—no, not
so <em>easy</em>—t’ do without that sweetness in my
tea.”
</p>
<p>
Aunt Tibbie sighed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
</p>
<p>
“What <em>you</em> thinkin’ about, dear?” Jonathan
asked.
</p>
<p>
“I got a sinful hankerin’,” Aunt Tibbie answered,
repeating the sigh.
</p>
<p>
“Is you, dear?”
</p>
<p>
“I got a sinful hankerin’,” said she, “for that
there bottle o’ hair-restorer. For I don’t <em>want</em>
t’ go bald! God forgive me,” she cried, in an
agony of humiliation, “for this vanity!”
</p>
<p>
“Hush, dear!” Jonathan whispered, tenderly;
“for I loves you, bald or not!”
</p>
<p>
But Aunt Tibbie burst out crying.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>VII—“BY-AN’-BY” BROWN OF BLUNDER COVE</h2>
<p>
“By-an’-by” Brown he was called at
Blunder Cove. And as “By-an’-by” Brown
he was known within its fishing radius: Grave
Head to Blow-me-down Billy. Momentarily, on
the wet night of his landing, he had been “Mister”
Brown; then—just “By-an’-by” Brown.
</p>
<p>
There was no secret about the baby. Young
Brown was a bachelor of the outports: even so,
there was still no secret about the baby. Nonsense!
It was not “By-an’-by’s.” It never had
been. Name? Tweak. Given name? She.
What! Well, then, <em>It</em>! Age? Recent—somewheres
’long about midsummer. Blunder Cove
was amazed, but, being used to sudden peril, to
misfortune, and strange chances, was not incredulous.
Blunder Cove was sympathetic: so
sympathetic, indeed, so quick to minister and to
assist, that “By-an’-by” Brown, aged fifteen,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
having taken but transient shelter for the child,
remained to rear it, forever proposing, however,
to proceed—by-and-by. So there they were,
“By-an’-by” Brown and the baby! And the
baby was not “By-an’-by’s.” Everybody knew
it—even the baby: perhaps best of all.
</p>
<p>
“By-an’-by” Brown had adopted the baby at
Back Yard Bight of the Labrador. There had
been nothing else to do. It was quite out of the
question, whatever the proprieties, whatever the
requirements of babies and the inadequacy of
bachelors—it was quite out of the question for
“By-an’-by” Brown, being a bachelor of tender
years and perceptions, to abandon even a baby
at Back Yard Bight of the Labrador, having first
assisted at the interment of the mother and then
instantly lost trace of the delinquent father. The
monstrous expedient had not even occurred to
him; he made a hasty bundle of the baby and
took flight for more populous neighborhoods,
commanding advice, refuge, and infinitely more
valuable assistance from the impoverished settlements
by the way. And thereafter he remembered
the bleak and lonely reaches of Back Yard
Bight as a stretch of coast where he had been
considerably alarmed.
</p>
<p>
It had been a wet night when “By-an’-by”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
Brown and the baby put into Blunder Cove—wind
in the east, the sea in a tumble: a wet night,
and late of it. All the windows were black; and
the paths of the place—a water-side maze in the
lee of great hills—were knee-deep in a flood of
darkness. “By-an’-by” Brown was downcast:
this because of his years. He was a lad of
fifteen. Fifteen, mark you!—a gigantic fifteen: a
wise and competent fifteen, too, having for seven
years fended for itself in the turf huts of the
Labrador and the forecastles of the lower coasts.
But still, for the moment, he was downcast by
the burden upon his youth. So he knocked diffidently
at the first kitchen door; and presently
he stood abashed in a burst of warm light from
within.
</p>
<p>
Shelter? Oh, ay! T’ be sure. But (in quick
and resentful suspicion):
</p>
<p>
“B’y,” Aunt Phoebe Luff demanded, “what
ye got in them ile-skins? Pups?”
</p>
<p>
“By-an’-by” Brown observed that there were
embers in the kitchen stove, that steam was
faintly rising from the spout of the kettle.
</p>
<p>
“Baby,” said he.
</p>
<p>
Aunt Phoebe jumped. “What!” cried she:
</p>
<p>
“Jus’ a baby,” said “By-an’-by” Brown.
“<em>Well!</em>—you give that there baby here.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be glad t’, ma’am,” said young “By-an’-by”
Brown, in childish tenderness, still withholding
the bundle from the woman’s extended
arms, “but not for keeps.”
</p>
<p>
“For keeps!” Aunt Phoebe snorted.
</p>
<p>
“No, ma’am; not for keeps. I’m ’lowin’ t’
fetch it up myself,” said “By-an’-by” Brown,
“by-an’-by.”
</p>
<p>
“Dunderhead!” Aunt Phoebe whispered, softly.
</p>
<p>
And “By-an’-by” Brown, familiar with the
exigency, obediently went in.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
<em>Then</em> there were lights in the cottages of
Blunder Cove: instantly, it seemed. And company—and
tea and hard bread and chatter—in
Skipper Tom Luff’s little white kitchen. A roaring
fire in the stove: a kettle that sang and
chuckled and danced, glad once more to be engaged
in the real business of life. So was the
cradle—glad to be useful again, though its activity
had been but for an hour suspended. It
went to work in a business-like way, with never
a creak, in response to the gentle toe of “By-an’-by”
Brown’s top-boot. There was an inquisition,
too, through which “By-an’-by” Brown
crooned to the baby, “Hush-a-by!” and absently
answered, “Uh-huh!” and “By-an’-by!” as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
placid as could be. Concerning past troubles:
Oh, they was—yesterday. And of future difficulties:
Well, they was—by-an’-by. “Hush-a-by!”
and “By-an’-by!” So they gave him a
new name—“By-an’-by” Brown—because he
was of those whose past is forgot in yesterday
and whose future is no more inimical than—well,
jus’ by-an’-by.
</p>
<p>
“By-an’-by” Brown o’ Blunder Cove—paddle-punt
fishin’ the Blow-me-down grounds....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
It had not been for keeps. “By-an’-by”
Brown resisted in a fashion so resolute that no
encroachment upon his rights was accomplished
by Aunt Phoebe Luff. He had wandered too
long alone to be willing to yield up a property in
hearts once he possessed it. And Blunder Cove
approved. The logic was simple: <em>If</em> “By-an’-by”
Brown took the child t’ raise, why, then,
nobody else would <em>have</em> t’. The proceeding was
never regarded as extraordinary. Nobody said,
“How queer!” It was looked upon merely as a
commendably philanthropic undertaking on the
part of “By-an’-by” Brown; the accident of his
sex and situation had nothing to do with the
problem. Thus, when Aunt Phoebe’s fostering
care was no longer imperative “By-an’-by”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
Brown said <em>Now</em> for the first time in his life,
and departed with the baby. By that time, of
course, there was an establishment: a whitewashed
cottage by the water-side, a stage, a flake,
a punt—all the achievement of “By-an’-by’s”
own hands. A new account, too: this on the
ledger of Wull &amp; Company, trading the French
Shore with the <em>Always Loaded</em>, putting in off and on.
</p>
<p>
“By-an’-by’s” baby began to grow perceptibly.
“By-an’-by” just kept on growing, ’lowin’
t’ stop sometime—by-an’-by. It happened—by-an’-by.
This was when he was two-and-twenty:
by which time, according to enthusiastic observers
from a more knowing and appreciative
world, he was Magnificent. The splendor consisted,
it was said, in bulk, muscle, and the like,
somewhat, too, perhaps, in poise and glance; but
Blunder Cove knew that these external and relatively
insignificant aspects were transcended by
the spiritual graces which “By-an’-by” Brown
displayed. He was religious; but it must be
added that he was amiable. A great, tender,
devoted dog: “By-an’-by” Brown. This must
be said for him: that if he by-an’-byed the unpleasant
necessities into a future too distant to be
troublesome, he by-an’-byed the appearance of
evil to the same far exile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
After all, it may be a virtue to practise the art
of by-an’-bying.
</p>
<p>
As for the baby at this period, the age of seven
years, the least said the less conspicuous the
failure to say anything adequate. Language was
never before so helplessly mocked. It may be
ventured, however, to prove the poverty of words,
that dispassionately viewed through the eyes of
“By-an’-by” Brown, she was angelic. “Jus’ a
wee li’l’ mite of a angel!” said he. Of course,
this is not altogether original, nor is it specific;
but it satisfied “By-an’-by” Brown’s idea of
perfection. A slim little slip of a maid of the
roguishly sly and dimpled sort: a maid of delicate
fashioning, exquisite of feature—a maid of impulsive
affections. Exact in everything; and exacting,
too—in a captivating way. And herein
was propagated the germ of disquietude for “By-an’-by”
Brown: promising, indeed (fostered by
the folly of procrastination), a more tragic development.
“By-an’-by’s” baby was used to saying,
You <em>told</em> me so. Also, But you <em>promised</em>.
The particular difficulty confronting “By-an’-by”
Brown was the baby’s insistent curiosity, not
inconsistent with the age of seven, concerning
the whereabouts of her father and the time and
manner of his return.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
</p>
<p>
Brown had piqued it into being: just by saying—“By-an’-by!”
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” says she; “but <em>when</em> will he be comin’
back?”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” he answered, bewildered—“by-an’-by!”
</p>
<p>
It was a familiar evasion. The maid frowned.
“Is you sure?” she demanded, sceptically.
</p>
<p>
“Ye bet ye!” he was prompt to reply, feeling
bound now, to convince her, whatever came of it;
“he’ll be comin’ back—by-an’-by.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, then,” said the maid, relieved, “I
s’pose so.”
</p>
<p>
Brown had never disclosed the brutal delinquency
of Long Bill Tweak. Not to the
maid, because he could not wound her; not to
Blunder Cove, because he would not shame her.
The revelation must be made, of course; but not
now—by-an’-by. The maid knew that her
mother was dead beyond recall: no mystery was
ever made of that; and there ended the childish
wish and wonder concerning that poor woman.
But her father? Here was an inviting mystery.
No; he was not what you might call dead—jus’
sort o’ gone away. Would he ever come back?
Oh, <em>sure</em>! no need o’ frettin’ about that; <em>he’d</em>
be back—by-an’-by. Had “By-an’-by” Brown
said <em>Never</em>, the problem would have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
dieposed of, once and for all: the fretting over with,
once and for all. But what he said was this uncourageous
and specious by-an’-by. So the maid
waited in interested speculation: then impatiently.
For she was used to saying, You <em>told</em> me so.
Also, But then you <em>promised</em>.
</p>
<p>
As by-an’-by overhauled by-an’-by in the days
of “By-an’-by” Brown, and as the ultimate by-an’-by
became imminent, “By-an’-by” Brown
was ever more disquieted.
</p>
<p>
“But,” says the maid, “‘by-an’-by’ is never.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my, no!” he protested.
</p>
<p>
She tapped the tip of his nose with a long little
forefinger, and emphasized every word with a
stouter tap. “Yes—it—is!” said she.
</p>
<p>
“Not <em>never</em>,” cried “By-an’-by” Brown.
</p>
<p>
“Then,” says she, “is it to-morrow?”
</p>
<p>
Brown violently shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“Is it nex’ week?”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness, no!”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” she insisted—and she took “By-an’-by’s”
face between her palms and drew it close
to search his eyes—“is it nex’ year?”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe.”
</p>
<p>
She touched the tip of her white little nose to the
sunburned tip of his. “But <em>is</em> it?” she persisted.
</p>
<p>
“Uh-huh,” said “By-an’-by” Brown, recklessly, quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
overcome, committing himself beyond
redemption; “nex’ year.”
</p>
<p>
And “By-an’-by’s” baby remembered....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Next year began, of course, with the first day
of January. And a day with wind and snow it
was! Through the interval of three months
preceding, Brown had observed the approach of
this veritable by-an’-by with rising alarm. And
on New Year’s Day, why, there it was: by-an’-by
come at last! “By-an’-by” Brown, though
twenty-two, was frightened. No wonder! Hitherto
his life had not been perturbed by insoluble
bewilderments. But how to produce Long Bill
Tweak from the mist into which he had vanished
at Back Yard Bight of the Labrador seven years
ago? It was beyond him. Who could call Bill
Tweak from seven years of time and the very
waste places of space? Not “By-an’-by” Brown,
who could only ponder and sigh and scratch his
curly head. And here was the maid, used to
saying, as maids of seven will, But you told me
so! and, You <em>promised</em>! So “By-an’-by” Brown
was downcast as never before; but before the
day was spent he conceived that the unforeseen
might yet fortuitously issue in the salvation of
himself and the baby.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
</p>
<p>
“Maybe,” thought he—“by-an’-by!”
</p>
<p>
As January progressed the maid grew more
eager and still more confident. He <em>promised</em>,
thinks she; also, He <em>told</em> me so. There were
times, as the terrified Brown observed, when this
eagerness so possessed the child that she trembled
in a fashion to make him shiver. She would
start from her chair by the stove when a knock
came late o’ windy nights on the kitchen door;
she would stare up the frozen harbor to the Tickle
by day—peep through the curtains, interrupt her
housewifely duties to keep watch at the window.
</p>
<p>
“Anyhow, he <em>will</em> come,” says she, quite confidently,
“by-an’-by.”
</p>
<p>
“Uh-huh!” Brown must respond.
</p>
<p>
What was a shadow upon the gentle spirit of
“By-an’-by” Brown was the sunlight of certain
expectation irradiating “By-an’-by’s” baby. But
the maid fell ill. Nobody knew why. Suspicion
dwelled like a skeleton with “By-an’-by”
Brown; but this he did not divulge to Blunder
Cove. Nothin’ much the matter along o’ she,
said the Cove; jus’ a little spell o’ somethin’ or
other. It was a childish indisposition, perhaps—but
come with fever and pallor and a poignant
restlessness. “By-an’-by” Brown had never before
known how like to a black cloud the future
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
of a man might be. At any rate, she must be
put to bed: whereupon, of course, “By-an’-by”
Brown indefinitely put off going to bed, having
rather stand watch, he said. It was presently
a question at Blunder Cove: who was the more
wan and pitiable, “By-an’-by’s” baby, being
sick, or “By-an’-by,” being anxious? And there
was no cure anywhere to be had—no cure for
either. “By-an’-by” Brown conceived that the
appearance of Long Bill Tweak would instantly
work a miracle upon the maid. But where was
Bill Tweak? There was no magic at hand to
accomplish the feat of summoning a scamp from
Nowhere!
</p>
<p>
One windy night “By-an’-by” Brown sat with
the child to comfort her. “I ’low,” he drawled,
“that you wisht a wonderful sight that your
father was here.”
</p>
<p>
“Uh-<em>huh</em>!” the maid exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
Brown sighed. “I s’pose,” he muttered.
</p>
<p>
“Is he comin’?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Oh—by-an’-by!”
</p>
<p>
“I wisht ’twas <em>now</em>,” said she. “That I
does!”
</p>
<p>
Brown listened to the wind. It was blowing
high and bitterly: a winter wind, with snow from
the northeast. “By-an’-by” was troubled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
“I ’low,” said he, hopelessly, “that you’ll love
un a sight, won’t ye?—when he comes?”
</p>
<p>
“Ye bet ye!” the maid answered.
</p>
<p>
“More’n ye love—some folks?”
</p>
<p>
“A lot,” said she.
</p>
<p>
Brown was troubled. He heard the kitchen
stove snore in its familiar way, the kettle bubble,
the old wind assault the cottage he had builded
for the baby; and he remembered recent years—and was
troubled.
</p>
<p>
“Will ye love un more?” he asked, anxiously,
turning his face from the child, “than ye loves
me?” He hesitated. “Ye won’t, will ye?” he
implored.
</p>
<p>
“’Twill be different,” said she.
</p>
<p>
“Will it?” he asked, rather vacantly.
</p>
<p>
“Ye see,” she explained, “he’ll be my <em>father</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Then,” suggested “By-an’-by,” “ye’ll be goin’
away along o’ he?—when he comes?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my, no!”
</p>
<p>
“Ye’ll not? Ye’ll stay along o’ me?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, ye see,” she began, bewildered, “I’ll—why,
o’ course, I’ll—oh,” she complained, “what
ye ask me <em>that</em> for?”
</p>
<p>
“Jus’ couldn’t <em>help</em> it,” said “By-an’-by,”
humbly.
</p>
<p>
The maid began to cry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t!” pleaded “By-an’-by” Brown. “Jus’
can’t <em>stand</em> it. I’ll do anything if ye’ll on’y stop
cryin’. Ye can <em>have</em> your father. Ye needn’t
love me no more. Ye can go away along o’ he.
An’ he’ll be comin’ soon, too. Ye’ll see if he
don’t. Jus’ by-an’-by—by-an’-by!”
</p>
<p>
“’Tis never,” the maid sobbed.
</p>
<p>
“No, no! By-an’-by is soon. Why,” cried
“By-an’-by” Brown, perceiving that this intelligence
stopped the child’s tears, “by-an’-by is—wonderful
soon.”
</p>
<p>
“To-morrow?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, no; but—”
</p>
<p>
“’Tis never!” she wailed.
</p>
<p>
“’Tis nex’ week!” cried “By-an’-by”
Brown....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
When the dawn of Monday morning confronted
“By-an’-by” Brown he was appalled.
Here was a desperately momentous situation:
by-an’-by must be faced—at last. Where was
Long Bill Tweak? Nobody knew. How could
Long Bill Tweak be fetched from Nowhere?
Brown scratched his head. But Long Bill
Tweak <em>must</em> be fetched: for here was the maid,
chirpin’ about the kitchen—turned out early,
ecod! t’ clean house against her father’s coming.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
Cured? Ay; that she was—the mouse! “By-an’-by”
Brown dared not contemplate her
collapse at midnight of Saturday. But chance
intervened: on Tuesday morning Long Bill
Tweak made Blunder Cove on the way from
Lancy Loop to St. John’s to join the sealing fleet
in the spring of the year. Long Bill Tweak in
the flesh! It was still blowing high: he had
come out of the snow—a shadow in the white
mist, rounding the Tickle rocks, observed from
all the windows of Blunder Cove, but changing
to Long Bill Tweak himself, ill-kempt, surly,
gruff-voiced, vicious-eyed, at the kitchen door of
“By-an’-by” Brown’s cottage.
</p>
<p>
Long Bill Tweak begged the maid, with a
bristle-whiskered twitch—a scowl, mistakenly delivered
as a smile—for leave to lie the night in
that place.
</p>
<p>
The maid was afraid with a fear she had not
known before. “We’re ’lowing for company,”
she objected.
</p>
<p>
“Come in!” “By-an’-by” called from the
kitchen.
</p>
<p>
The maid fled in a fright to the inner room,
and closed the door upon herself; but Long Bill
Tweak swaggered in.
</p>
<p>
“Tweak!” gasped “By-an’-by” Brown.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
</p>
<p>
“Brown!” growled Long Bill Tweak.
</p>
<p>
There was the silence of uttermost amazement;
but presently, with a jerk, Tweak indicated
the door through which “By-an’-by’s”
baby had fled.
</p>
<p>
“It?” he whispered.
</p>
<p>
Brown nodded.
</p>
<p>
“’Low I’ll be goin’ on,” said Long Bill Tweak,
making for the windy day.
</p>
<p>
“Ye’ll go,” answered “By-an’-by” Brown,
quietly, interposing his great body, “when ye’re
let: not afore.”
</p>
<p>
Long Bill Tweak contented himself with the
hospitality of “By-an’-by” Brown....
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
That night, when Brown had talked with the
maid’s father for a long, long time by the kitchen
stove, the maid being then turned in, he softly
opened the bedroom door and entered, closing it
absent-mindedly behind him, dwelling the while,
in deep distress, upon the agreement he had
wrested by threat and purchase from Long Bill
Tweak. The maid was still awake because of
terror; she was glad, indeed, to have caught sight
of “By-an’-by” Brown’s broad, kindly young
countenance in the beam of light from the kitchen,
though downcast, and she snuggled deeper into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
the blankets, not afraid any more. “By-an’-by”
touched a match to the candle-wick with a great
hand that trembled. He lingered over the simple
act—loath to come nearer to the evil necessity of
the time. For Long Bill Tweak was persuaded
now to be fatherly to the child; and “By-an’-by”
Brown must yield her, according to her wish.
He sat for a time on the edge of the little bed,
clinging to the maid’s hand; and he thought, in
his gentle way, that it was a very small, very dear
hand, and that he would wish to touch it often,
when he could not.
</p>
<p>
Presently Brown sighed: then, taking heart, he
joined issue with his trouble.
</p>
<p>
“I ’low,” he began, “that you wisht your
father was here.”
</p>
<p>
The maid did.
</p>
<p>
“I ’low,” he pursued, “that you wisht he was
here this very minute.”
</p>
<p>
That the maid did!
</p>
<p>
“I ’low,” said “By-an’-by,” softly, lifting the
child’s hands to his lips, “that you wisht the man
in the kitchen was him.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” the maid answered, sharply.
</p>
<p>
“Ye doesn’t?”
</p>
<p>
“Ye bet ye—no!” said she.
</p>
<p>
“Eh?” gasped the bewildered Brown.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
The maid sat upright and stiff in bed. “Oh,
my!” she demanded, in alarm; “he <em>isn’t</em>, is he?”
</p>
<p>
“No!” said “By-an’-by” Brown.
</p>
<p>
“Sure?”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t I jus’ <em>tol’</em> ye so?” he answered, beaming.
</p>
<p>
Long Bill Tweak followed the night into the
shades of forgotten time....

<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Came Wednesday upon “By-an’-by” Brown
in a way to make the heart jump. Midnight of
Saturday was now fairly over the horizon of his
adventurous sea. Wednesday! Came Thursday—prompt to
the minute. Days of bewildered
inaction! And now the cottage was ship-shape
to the darkest corners of its closets. Ship-shape as
a wise and knowing maid of seven, used to housewifely
occupations, could make it: which was as
ship-shape as ship-shape could be, though you
may not believe it. There was no more for the
maid to do but sit with folded hands and confidently
expectant gaze to await the advent of
her happiness. Thursday morning: and “By-an’-by”
Brown had not mastered his bearings.
Three days more: Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
It occurred, then, to “By-an’-by” Brown—at
precisely ten o’clock of Friday morning—that his
hope lay in Jim Turley of Candlestick Cove, an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
obliging man. They jus’ <em>had</em> t’ be a father,
didn’t they? But they <em>wasn’t</em> no father no more.
Well, then, ecod! <em>make</em> one. Had t’ be a father,
<em>some</em>how, didn’t they? And—well—there was
Jim Turley o’ Candlestick Cove. He’d answer.
Why not Jim Turley o’ Candlestick Cove, an
obligin’ man, known t’ be such from Mother
Burke t’ the Cape Norman Light? He’d ’blige
a shipmate in a mess like this, ecod! You see
if he didn’t!
</p>
<p>
Brown made ready for Candlestick Cove.
</p>
<p>
“But,” the maid objected, “what is I t’ do if
father comes afore night?”
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” drawled “By-an’-by,” blankly.
</p>
<p>
“Eh?” she repeated.
</p>
<p>
“Why, o’ course,” he answered, with a large
and immediate access of interest, drawing the
arm-chair near the stove, “you jus’ set un there t’
warm his feet.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ if he doesn’t know me?” she protested.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, sure,” “By-an’-by” affirmed, “the ol’
man’ll know <em>you</em>, never fear. You jus’ give un
a cup o’ tea an’ say I’ll be back afore dark.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” the maid agreed, dubiously.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be off,” said Brown, in a flush of embarrassment,
“when I fetches the wood t’ keep
your father cosey. He’ll be thirsty an’ cold when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
he comes. Ye’ll take good care of un, won’t
ye?”
</p>
<p>
“Ye bet ye!”
</p>
<p>
“Mind ye get them there ol’ feet warm. An’
jus’ you fair pour the tea into un. He’s used t’
his share o’ tea, ye bet! <em>I</em> knows un.”
</p>
<p>
And so “By-an’-by” Brown, travelling over
the hills, came hopefully to Jim Turley of Candlestick
Cove, an obliging man, whilst the maid
kept watch at the window of the Blunder Cove
cottage. And Jim Turley was a most obligin’
man. ’Blige? Why, sure! <em>I’ll</em> ’blige ye! There
was no service difficult or obnoxious to the selfish
sons of men that Jim Turley would not perform
for other folk—if only he might ’blige. Ye
jus’ go ast Jim Turley; <em>he’ll</em> ’blige ye. And
Jim Turley would with delight: for Jim had a
passion for ’bligin’—assiduously seeking opportunities,
even to the point of intrusion. Beaming
Jim Turley o’ Candlestick Cove: poor, shiftless,
optimistic, serene, well-beloved Jim Turley,
forever cheerfully sprawling in the meshes of his
own difficulties! Lean Jim Turley—forgetful of
his interests in a fairly divine satisfaction with
compassing the joy and welfare of his fellows!
I shall never forget him: his round, flaring smile,
rippling under his bushy whiskers, a perpetual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
delight, come any fortune; his mild, unself-conscious,
sympathetic blue eyes, looking out upon
the world in amazement, perhaps, but yet in
kind and eager inquiry concerning the affairs
of other folk; his blithe “Yo-ho!” at labor, and
“Easy does it!” Jim Turley o’ Candlestick Cove—an’
obligin’ man!
</p>
<p>
“In trouble?” he asked of “By-an’-by” Brown,
instantly concerned.
</p>
<p>
“Not ’xactly trouble,” answered “By-an’-by.”
</p>
<p>
“Sort o’ bothered?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, no,” drawled “By-an’-by” Brown; “but
I got t’ have a father by Satu’day night.”
</p>
<p>
“For yerself?” Jim mildly inquired.
</p>
<p>
“For the maid,” said “By-an’-by” Brown;
“an’ I was ’lowin’,” he added, frankly, “that
you might ’blige her.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, now,” Jim Turley exclaimed, “I’d
like t’ wonderful well! But, ye see,” he objected,
faintly, “bein’ a ol’ bachelor I isn’t s’posed
t’—”
</p>
<p>
“Anyhow,” “By-an’-by” Brown broke in,
“I jus’ got t’ have a father by Satu’day night.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ I’m a religious man, an’—”
</p>
<p>
“No objection t’ religion,” Brown protested.
“I’m strong on religion m’self. Jus’ as soon
have a religious father as not. Sooner. Now,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
he pleaded, “they isn’t nobody else in the world
t’ ’blige me.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” Jim Turley agreed, in distress; “no—I
’low not.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ I jus’ <em>got</em>,” declared Brown, “t’ have a
father by Satu’day night.”
</p>
<p>
“Course you is!” cried Jim Turley, instantly
siding with the woebegone. “Jus’ got t’!”
</p>
<p>
“Well?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well, pshaw!” said Jim Turley, “<em>I’ll</em>
’blige ye!”
</p>
<p>
The which he did, but with misgiving: arriving
at Blunder Cove after dark of Saturday, unobserved
by the maid, whose white little nose
was stuck to the frosty window-pane, whose eyes
searched the gloom gathered over the Tickle rocks,
whose ears were engaged with the tick-tock of
the impassive clock. No; he was not observed,
however keen the lookout: for he came sneaking
in by Tumble Gully, ’cordin’ t’ sailin’ orders, to
join “By-an’-by” Brown in the lee of the meeting-house
under Anxiety Hill, where the conspiracy
was to be perfected, in the light of recent developments,
and whence the sally was to be made.
He was in a shiver of nervousness; so, too, “By-an’-by”
Brown. It was the moment of inaction
when conspirators must forever be the prey of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
doubt and dread. They were determined, grim;
they were most grave—but they were still afraid.
And Jim Turley’s conscience would not leave
him be. A religious man, Jim Turley! On
the way from Candlestick Cove he had whipped
the perverse thing into subjection, like a sinner;
but here, in the lee of the meeting-house by
Anxiety Hill, with a winter’s night fallen like a
cold cloud from perdition, conscience was risen
again to prod him.
</p>
<p>
An obligin’ man, Jim Turley: but still a religious
man—knowing his master.
</p>
<p>
“I got qualms,” said he.
</p>
<p>
“Stummick?” Brown demanded, in alarm.
</p>
<p>
“This here thing,” Jim Turley protested,
“isn’t a religious thing to do.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe not,” replied “By-an’-by” Brown,
doggedly; “but I promised the maid a father by
Satu’day night, an’ I got t’ have un.”
</p>
<p>
“’Twould ease my mind a lot,” Jim Turley
pleaded, “t’ ask the parson. Come, now!”
</p>
<p>
“By-an’-by,” said “By-an’-by” Brown.
</p>
<p>
“No,” Jim Turley insisted; “now.”
</p>
<p>
The parson laughed; then laughed again, with
his head thrown back and his mouth fallen open
very wide. Presently, though, he turned grave,
and eyed “By-an’-by” Brown in a questioning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
anxious way, as though seeking to discover in
how far the big man’s happiness might be
chanced: whereupon he laughed once more,
quite reassured. He was a pompous bit of a
parson, this, used to commanding the conduct of
Blunder Cove; to controlling its affairs; to shaping
the destinies of its folk with a free, bold hand:
being in this both wise and most generously concerned,
so that the folk profited more than they
knew. And now, with “By-an’-by” Brown and
the maid on his hands, to say nothing of poor
Jim Turley, he did not hesitate; there was nothing
for it, thinks he, but to get “By-an’-by”
Brown out of the mess, whatever came of it,
and to arrange a future from which all by-an’-bying
must be eliminated. A new start, thinks
he; and the by-an’-by habit would work no further
injury. So he sat “By-an’-by” Brown and
Jim Turley by the kitchen stove, without a word
of explanation, and, still condescending no hint
of his purpose, but bidding them both sit tight to
their chairs, went out upon his business, which,
as may easily be surmised, was with the maid.
</p>
<p>
“Bein’ a religious man,” said Jim Turley,
solemnly, “he’ll mend it.”
</p>
<p>
When the parson came back there was nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
within her comprehension, which was
quite sufficient to her need. “By-an’-by” Brown
was sent home, with a kindly God-bless-ye! and
an injunction of the most severe description to
have done with by-an’-bying. He stumbled into
his own kitchen in a shamefaced way, prepared,
like a mischievous lad, to be scolded until his big
ears burned and his scalp tingled; and he was a
long, long time about hanging up his cap and
coat and taking off his shoes, never once glancing
toward the maid, who sat silent beyond the
kitchen stove. And then, when by no further
subterfuge could he prolong his immunity, he
turned boldly in her direction, patiently and
humbly to accept the inevitable correction, a
promise to do better already fashioned upon his
tongue. And there she sat, beyond the glowing
stove, grinning in a way to show her white little
teeth. Tears? Maybe: but only traces—where-left,
indeed, for the maid to learn, or, at least,
by her eyes shone all the brighter. And “By-an’-by”
Brown, reproaching himself bitterly, sat
down, with never a word, and began to trace
strange pictures on the floor with the big toe of
his gray-socked foot, while the kettle and the
clock and the fire sang the old chorus of comfort
and cheer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
</p>
<p>
The big man’s big toe got all at once furiously
interested in its artistic occupation.
</p>
<p>
“Ah-ha!” says “By-an’-by’s” baby, “<em>I</em> found
you out!”
</p>
<p>
“Uh-huh!” she repeated, threateningly, “I
found <em>you</em> out.”
</p>
<p>
“Did ye?” “By-an’-by” softly asked.
</p>
<p>
The maid came on tiptoe from behind the
stove, and made an arrangement of “By-an’-by”
Brown’s long legs convenient for straddling; and
having then settled herself on his knees, she
tipped up his face and fetched her own so close
that he could not dodge her eyes, but must look
in, whatever came of it; and then—to the reviving
delight of “By-an’-by” Brown—she tapped
his nose with a long little forefinger, emphasizing
every word with a stouter tap, saying:
</p>
<p>
“Yes—I—did!”
</p>
<p>
“Uh-huh!” he chuckled.
</p>
<p>
“An’,” said she, “I don’t <em>want</em> no father.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye don’t?” he cried, incredulous.
</p>
<p>
“Because,” she declared, “I’m ’lowin’ t’ take
care o’ <em>you</em>—an’ <em>marry</em> you.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye is?” he gasped.
</p>
<p>
“Ye bet ye, b’y,” said “By-an’-by’s” baby—“by-an’-by!”
</p>
<p>
Then they hugged each other hard.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>VIII—THEY WHO LOSE AT LOVE</h2>
<p>
And old Khalil Khayyat, simulating courage,
went out, that the reconciliation of Yusef
Khouri with the amazing marriage might surely
be accomplished. And returning in dread and
bewildered haste, he came again to the pastry-shop
of Nageeb Fiani, where young Salim Awad,
the light of his eyes, still lay limp over the round
table in the little back room, grieving that
Haleema, Khouri’s daughter, of the tresses of
night, the star-eyed, his well-beloved, had of a
sudden wed Jimmie Brady, the jolly truckman.
The smoke hung dead and foul in the room; the
coffee was turned cold in the cups, stagnant and
greasy; the coal on the narghile was grown gray
as death: the magic of great despair had in a twinkling
worked the change of cheer to age and
shabbiness and frigid gloom. But the laughter
and soft voices in the outer room were all unchanged,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
still light, lifted indifferently above the
rattle of dice and the aimless strumming of a
canoun; and beyond was the familiar evening
hum and clatter of New York’s Washington
Street, children’s cries and the patter of feet,
drifting in at the open door; and from far off,
as before, came the low, receding roar of the
Elevated train rounding the curve to South Ferry.
</p>
<p>
Khayyat smiled in compassion: being old, used
to the healing of years, he smiled; and he laid a
timid hand on the head of young Salim Awad.
</p>
<p>
“Salim, poet, the child of a poet,” he whispered,
“grieve no more!”
</p>
<p>
“My heart is a gray coal, O Khalil!” sighed
Salim Awad, who had lost at love. “For a moment
it glowed in the breath of love. It is
turned cold and gray; it lies forsaken in a vast
night.”
</p>
<p>
“For a moment,” mused Khalil Khayyat,
sighing, but yet smiling, “it glowed in the breath
of love. Ah, Salim,” said he, “there is yet the
memory of that ecstasy!”
</p>
<p>
“My heart is a brown leaf: it flutters down the
wind of despair; it is caught in the tempest of
great woe.”
</p>
<p>
“It has known the sunlight and the tender
breeze.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
</p>
<p>
Salim looked up; his face was wet and white;
his black hair, fallen in disarray over his forehead,
was damp with the sweat of grief; his eyes, soulful,
glowing in deep shadows, he turned to some
place high and distant. “My heart,” he cried,
passionately, clasping his hands, “is a thing that
for a moment lived, but is forever dead! It is in
a grave of night and heaviness, O Khalil, my
friend!”
</p>
<p>
“It is like a seed sown,” said Khalil Khayyat.
</p>
<p>
“To fail of harvest!”
</p>
<p>
“Nay; to bloom in compassionate deeds. The
flower of sorrow is the joy of the world. In the
broken heart is the hope of the hopeless; in the
agony of poets is their sure help. Hear me, O
Salim Awad!” the old man continued, rising,
lifting his lean brown hand, his voice clear,
vibrant, possessing the quality of prophecy.
“The broken heart is a seed sown by the hand of
the Beneficent and Wise. Into the soil of life
He casts it that there may be a garden in the
world. With a free, glad hand He sows, that
the perfume and color of high compassion may
glorify the harvest of ambitious strife; and progress
is the fruit of strife and love the flower of
compassion. Yea, O Salim, poet, the child of
a poet, taught of a poet, which am I, the broken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
heart is a seed sown gladly, to flower in this
beauty. Blessed,” Khalil Khayyat concluded,
smiling, “oh, blessed be the Breaker of Hearts!”
</p>
<p>
“Blessed,” asked Salim Awad, wondering,
“be the Breaker of Hearts?”
</p>
<p>
“Yea, O Salim,” answered Khalil Khayyat,
speaking out of age and ancient pain; “even
blessed be the Breaker of Hearts!”
</p>
<p>
Salim Awad turned again to the place that
was high and distant—beyond the gaudy, dirty
ceiling of the little back room—where, it may be,
the form of Haleema, the star-eyed, of the slender,
yielding shape of the tamarisk, floated in a radiant
cloud, compassionate and glorious.
</p>
<p>
“What is my love?” he whispered. “Is it a
consuming fire? Nay,” he answered, his voice
rising, warm, tremulous; “rather is it a little
blaze, kindled brightly in the night, that it may
comfort my beloved. What is my love, O Haleema,
daughter of Khouri, the star-eyed? Is it
an arrow, shot from my bow, that it may tear
the heart of my beloved? Nay; rather is it a
shield against the arrows of sorrow—my shield,
the strength of my right arm: a refuge from the
cruel shafts of life. What are my arms? Are
they bars of iron to imprison my beloved? Nay,”
cried Salim Awad, striking his breast; “they are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
but a resting-place. A resting-place,” he repeated,
throwing wide his arms, “to which she
will not come! Oh, Haleema!” he moaned,
flinging himself upon the little round table,
“Haleema! Jewel of all riches! Star of the
night! Flower of the world! Haleema ...
Haleema....”
</p>
<p>
“Poet!” Khalil Khayyat gasped, clutching the
little round table, his eyes flashing. “The child
of a poet, taught of a poet, which am I!”
</p>
<p>
They were singing in the street—a riot of Irish
lads, tenement-born; tramping noisily past the
door of Nageeb Fiani’s pastry-shop to Battery
Park. And Khalil Khayyat sat musing deeply,
his ears closed to the alien song, while distance
mellowed the voices, changed them to a vagrant
harmony, made them one with the mutter of
Washington Street; for there had come to him
a great thought—a vision, high, glowing, such as
only poets may know—concerning love and the
infinite pain; and he sought to fashion the
thought: which must be done with tender care
in the classic language, lest it suffer in beauty
or effect being uttered in haste or in the common
speech of the people. Thus he sat: low in his
chair, his head hanging loose, his eyes jumping,
his brown, wrinkled face fearfully working, until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
every hair of his unshaven beard stood restlessly
on end. And Salim Awad, looking up, perceived
these throes: and thereby knew that some prophetic
word was immediately to be spoken.
</p>
<p>
“They who lose at love,” Khayyat muttered,
“must.... They who lose at love....”
</p>
<p>
“Khalil!”
</p>
<p>
The Language Beautiful was for once perverse.
The words would not come to Khalil
Khayyat. He gasped, tapped the table with
impatient fingers—and bent again to the task.
</p>
<p>
“They who lose at love....”
</p>
<p>
“Khalil!” Salim Awad’s voice was plaintive.
“What must they do, O Khalil,” he implored,
“who lose at love? Tell me, Khalil! <em>What
must they do?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“They who lose at love.... They who lose at
love must.... They who lose at love must ...
seek....”
</p>
<p>
“Speak, O Khalil, concerning those wretched
ones! And they must seek?”
</p>
<p>
Khayyat laughed softly. He sat back in the
chair—proudly squared his shoulders. “And
now I know!” he cried, in triumph. He cleared
his throat. “They who lose at love,” he declaimed,
“must seek....” He paused abruptly.
There had been a warning in the young lover’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
eyes: after all, in exceptional cases, poetry might
not wisely be practised.
</p>
<p>
“Come, Khalil!” Salim Awad purred. “They
who lose at love? What is left for them to
do?”
</p>
<p>
“Nay,” answered Khalil Khayyat, looking
away, much embarrassed, “I will not tell you.”
</p>
<p>
Salim caught the old man’s wrist. “What is
the quest?” he cried, hoarsely, bending close.
</p>
<p>
“I may not tell.”
</p>
<p>
Salim’s fingers tightened; his teeth came together
with a snap; his face flushed—a quick
flood of red, hot blood.
</p>
<p>
“What is the quest?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“I dare not tell.”
</p>
<p>
“The quest?”
</p>
<p>
“I <em>will</em> not tell!”
</p>
<p>
Nor would Khalil Khayyat tell Salim Awad
what must be sought by such as lose at love; but
he called to Nageeb Fiani, the greatest player in
all the world, to bring the violin, that Salim
might hear the music of love and be comforted.
And in the little back room of the pastry-shop
near the Battery, while the trucks rattled over
the cobblestones and the songs of the Irish
troubled the soft spring night, Nageeb Fiani
played the Song of Love to Lali, which the blind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
prince had made, long, long ago, before he died
of love; and in the sigh and wail and passionate
complaint of that dead woe the despair of Salim
Awad found voice and spent itself; and he
looked up, and gazing deep into the dull old
eyes of Khalil Khayyat, new light in his own, he
smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Yet, O Khalil,” he whispered, “will I go
upon that quest!”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Now, Salim Awad went north to the bitter
coasts—to the shore of rock and gray sea—there
to carry a pack from harbor to harbor of a barren
land, ever seeking in trade to ease the sorrows
of love. Neither sea nor land—neither naked
headland nor the unfeeling white expanse—neither
sunlit wind nor the sleety gale in the
night—helped him to forgetfulness. But, as all
the miserable know, the love of children is a vast
delight: and the children of that place are blue-eyed
and hungry; and it is permitted the stranger
to love them.... On he went, from Lobster
Tickle to Snook’s Arm, from Dead Man’s Cove
to Righteous Harbor, trading laces and trinkets
for salt fish; and on he went, sanguine, light of
heart, blindly seeking that which the losers at
love must seek; for Khalil Khayyat had told him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
that the mysterious Thing was to be found in
that place.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
With a jolly wind abeam—a snoring breeze
from the southwest—the tight little <em>Bully Boy</em>,
fore-and-after, thirty tons, Skipper Josiah Top,
was footing it through the moonlight from Tutt’s
Tickle to the Labrador: bound down north for
the first fishing of that year. She was tearing
through the sea—eagerly nosing the slow, black
waves; and they heartily slapped her bows, broke,
ran hissing down the rail, lay boiling in the broad,
white wake, stretching far into the luminous mist
astern. Salim Awad, the peddler, picked up at
Bread-and-Water Harbor, leaned upon the rail—staring
into the mist: wherein, for him, were
melancholy visions of the star-eyed maid of
Washington Street.... At midnight the wind
veered to the east—a swift, ominous change—and
rose to the pitch of half a gale, blowing cold
and capriciously. It brought fog from the distant
open; the night turned clammy and thick;
the <em>Bully Boy</em> found herself in a mess of dirty
weather. Near dawn, being then close inshore,
off the Seven Dogs, which growled to leeward,
she ran into the ice—the first of the spring floes:
a field of pans, slowly drifting up the land. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
when the air was gray she struck on the Devil’s
Finger, ripped her keel out, and filled like a sieve;
and she sank in sixty seconds, as men say—every
strand and splinter of her.
</p>
<p>
But first she spilled her crew upon the ice.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
The men had leaped to port and starboard,
fore and aft, in unthinking terror, each desperately
concerned with his own life; they were
now distributed upon the four pans which had
been within leaping distance when the <em>Bully
Boy</em> settled: white rafts, floating on a black,
slow-heaving sea; lying in a circle of murky
fog; creeping shoreward with the wind. If the
wind held—and it was a true, freshening wind,—they
would be blown upon the coast rocks,
within a measurable time, and might walk
ashore; if it veered, the ice would drift to sea,
where, ultimately, in the uttermost agony of
cold and hunger, every man would yield his life.
The plight was manifest, familiar to them,
every one; but they were wise in weather lore:
they had faith in the consistency of the wind that
blew; and, in the reaction from bestial terror,
they bandied primitive jokes from pan to pan—save
the skipper, who had lost all that he had,
and was helplessly downcast: caring not a whit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
whether he lived or died; for he had loved his
schooner, the work of his hands, his heart’s
child, better than his life.
</p>
<p>
It chanced that Salim Awad, who loved the
star-eyed daughter of Khouri, and in this land
sought to ease the sorrow of his passion—it
chanced that this Salim was alone with Tommy
Hand, the cook’s young son—a tender lad, now
upon his first voyage to the Labrador. And
the boy began to whimper.
</p>
<p>
“Dad,” he called to his father, disconsolate,
“I wisht—I wisht—I was along o’ you—on <em>your</em>
pan.”
</p>
<p>
The cook came to the edge of the ice. “Does
you, lad?” he asked, softly. “Does you wisht
you was along o’ me, Tommy? Ah, but,” he
said, scratching his beard, bewildered, “you
isn’t.”
</p>
<p>
The space of black water between was short,
but infinitely capacious; it was sullen and cold—intent
upon its own wretchedness: indifferent
to the human pain on either side. The child
stared at the water, nostrils lifting, hands clinched,
body quivering: thus as if at bay in the
presence of an implacable terror. He turned to
the open sea, vast, gray, heartless: a bitter waste—might
and immensity appalling. Wistfully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
then to the land, upon which the scattered pack
was advancing, moving in disorder, gathering as
it went: bold, black coast, naked, uninhabited—but
yet sure refuge: being greater than the sea,
which it held confined; solid ground, unmoved
by the wind, which it flung contemptuously to
the sky. And from the land to his father’s large,
kind face.
</p>
<p>
“No, b’y,” the cook repeated, “you isn’t.
You sees, Tommy lad,” he added, brightening,
as with a new idea, “you <em>isn’t</em> along o’ me.”
</p>
<p>
Tommy rubbed his eyes, which were now wet.
“I wisht,” he sobbed, his under lip writhing, “I
<em>was</em>—along o’ you!”
</p>
<p>
“I isn’t able t’ swim t’ you, Tommy,” said the
cook; “an’, ah, Tommy!” he went on, reproachfully,
wagging his head, “you isn’t able t’ swim
t’ me. I tol’ you, Tommy—when I went down
the Labrador las’ year—I <em>tol’</em> you t’ l’arn t’
swim. I tol’ you, Tommy—don’t you mind the
time?—when you was goin’ over the side o’ th’
ol’ <em>Gabriel’s Trumpet</em>, an’ I had my head out o’
the galley, an’ ’twas a fair wind from the sou’east,
an’ they was weighin’ anchor up for’ard—don’t
you mind the day, lad?—I tol’ you, Tommy,
you <em>must</em> l’arn t’ swim afore another season.
Now, see what’s come t’ you!” still reproachfully,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
but with deepening tenderness. “An’ all along
o’ not mindin’ your dad! ‘Now,’ says you, ‘I
wisht I’d been a good lad an’ minded my dad.’
Ah, Tommy—shame! I’m thinkin’ you’ll mind
your dad after this.”
</p>
<p>
Tommy began to bawl.
</p>
<p>
“Never you care, Tommy,” said the cook.
“The wind’s blowin’ we ashore. You an’ me’ll
be saved.”
</p>
<p>
“I wants t’ be along o’ you!” the boy sobbed.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, Tommy! <em>You</em> isn’t alone. You got
the Jew.”
</p>
<p>
“But I wants <em>you</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll take care o’ Tommy, won’t you,
Joe?”
</p>
<p>
Salim Awad smiled. He softly patted Tommy
Hand’s broad young shoulder. “I weel have,”
said he, slowly, desperately struggling with the
language, “look out for heem. I am not can,”
he added, with a little laugh, “do ver’ well.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” said the cook, patronizingly, “you’re
able for it, Joe.”
</p>
<p>
“I am can try eet,” Salim answered, courteously
bowing, much delighted. “Much ’bliged.”
</p>
<p>
Meantime Tommy had, of quick impulse,
stripped off his jacket and boots. He made a
ball of the jacket and tossed it to his father.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
“What you about, Tommy?” the cook demanded.
“Is you goin’ t’ swim?”
</p>
<p>
Tommy answered with the boots; whereupon
he ran up and down the edge of the pan, and, at
last, slipped like a reluctant dog into the water,
where he made a frothy, ineffectual commotion;
after which he sank. When he came to the surface
Salim Awad hauled him inboard.
</p>
<p>
“You isn’t goin’ t’ try again, is you, Tommy?”
the cook asked.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
Salim Awad began to breathe again; his eyes,
too, returned to their normal size, their usual place.
</p>
<p>
“No,” the cook observed. “’Tis wise not to.
You isn’t able for it, lad. Now, you sees what
comes o’ not mindin’ your dad.”
</p>
<p>
The jacket and boots were tossed back.
Tommy resumed the jacket.
</p>
<p>
“Tommy,” said the cook, severely, “isn’t you
got no more sense ’n that?”
</p>
<p>
“Please, sir,” Tommy whispered, “I forgot.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, <em>did</em> you! <em>Did</em> you forget? I’m thinkin’,
Tommy, I hasn’t been bringin’ of you up very
well.”
</p>
<p>
Tommy stripped himself to his rosy skin. He
wrung the water out of his soggy garments and
with difficulty got into them again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
</p>
<p>
“You better be jumpin’ about a bit by times,”
the cook advised, “or you’ll be cotchin’ cold.
An’ your mamma wouldn’t like <em>that</em>,” he concluded,
“if she ever come t’ hear on it.”
</p>
<p>
“Ay, sir; please, sir,” said the boy.
</p>
<p>
They waited in dull patience for the wind to
blow the floe against the coast.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
It began to snow—a thick fall, by-and-by:
the flakes fine and dry as dust. A woolly curtain
shut coast and far-off sea from view. The wind,
rising still, was charged with stinging frost. It
veered; but it blew sufficiently true to the favorable
direction: the ice still made ponderously for
the shore, reeling in the swell.... The great pan
bearing Salim Awad and Tommy Hand lagged;
it was soon left behind: to leeward the figures of
the skipper, the cook, the first hand, and the
crew turned to shadows—dissolved in the cloud
of snow. The cook’s young son and the love-lorn
peddler from Washington Street alone peopled
a world of ice and water, all black and
white: heaving, confined. They huddled, cowering
from the wind, waiting—helpless, patient:
themselves detached from the world of ice and
water, which clamored round about, unrecognized.
The spirit of each returned: the one to the Cedars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
of Lebanon, the other to Lobster Cove; and in
each place there was a mother. In plights like
this the hearts of men and children turn to distant
mothers; for in all the world there is no rest
serene—no rest remembered—like the first rest
the spirits of men know.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
When dusk began to dye the circumambient
cloud, the pan of ice was close inshore; the shape
of the cliffs—a looming shadow—was vague in
the snow beyond. There was no longer any roar
of surf; the first of the floe, now against the coast,
had smothered the breakers. A voice, coming
faintly into the wind, apprised Tommy Hand
that his father was ashore.... But the pan still
moved sluggishly.
</p>
<p>
Tommy Hand shivered.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, Tom-ee!” Salim Awad said, anxiously.
“Run! Jump! You weel have—what say?—cotch
seek. Ay—cotch thee seek. Eh? R-r-run,
Tom-ee!”
</p>
<p>
“Ay, ay,” Tommy Hand answered. “I’ll be
jumpin’ about a bit, I’m thinkin’, t’ keep warm—as
me father bid me do.”
</p>
<p>
“Queek!” cried Salim, laughing.
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” Tommy muttered; “as me father bid
me do.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
</p>
<p>
“Jump, Tom-ee!” Salim clapped his hands.
“Hi, hi! Dance, Tom-ee!”
</p>
<p>
In the beginning Tommy was deliberate and
ponderous; but as his limbs were suppled—and
when his blood ran warm again—the dance
quickened; for Salim Awad slapped strangely
inspiring encouragement, and with droning “la,
la!” and sharp “hi, hi!” excited the boy to mad
leaps—and madder still. “La, la!” and “Hi,
hi!” There was a mystery in it. Tommy leaped
high and fast. “La, la!” and “Hi, hi!” In
response to the strange Eastern song the fisherboy’s
grotesque dance went on.... Came then the
appalling catastrophe: the pan of rotten, brittle
salt-water ice cracked under the lad; and it fell
in two parts, which, in the heave of the sea, at
once drifted wide of each other. The one part
was heavy, commodious; the other a mere unstable
fragment of what the whole had been:
and it was upon the fragment that Salim Awad
and Tommy Hand were left. Instinctively they
sprawled on the ice, which was now overweighted—unbalanced.
Their faces were close; and
as they lay rigid—while the ice wavered and
the water covered it—they looked into each
other’s eyes.... There was, not room for
both.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tom-ee,” Salim Awad gasped; his breath
indrawn, quivering, “I am—mus’—go!”
</p>
<p>
The boy stretched out his hand—an instinctive
movement, the impulse of a brave and generous
heart—to stop the sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
“Hush!” Salim Awad whispered, hurriedly,
lifting a finger to command peace. “I am—for
one queek time—have theenk. Hush, Tom-ee!”
</p>
<p>
Tommy Hand was silent.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
And Salim Awad heard again the clatter and
evening mutter of Washington Street, children’s
cries and the patter of feet, drifting in from the
soft spring night—heard again the rattle of dice
in the outer room, and the aimless strumming of
the canoun—heard again the voice of Khalil
Khayyat, lifted concerning such as lose at love.
And Salim Awad, staring into a place that was
high and distant, beyond the gaudy, dirty ceiling
of the little back room of Nageeb Fiani’s pastry-shop
near the Battery, saw again the form of
Haleema, Khouri’s star-eyed daughter, floating
in a cloud, compassionate and glorious. “‘The
sun as it sets,’” he thought, in the high words of
Antar, spoken of Abla, his beloved, the daughter
of Malik, when his heart was sore, “‘turns toward
her and says, “Darkness obscures the land, do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
thou arise in my absence.” The brilliant moon
calls out to her: “Come forth, for thy face is like
me, when I am in all my glory.” The tamarisk-trees
complain of her in the morn and in the eve,
and say: “Away, thou waning beauty, thou form
of the laurel!” She turns away abashed, and
throws aside her veil, and the roses are scattered
from her soft, fresh cheeks. Graceful is every
limb; slender her waist; love-beaming are her
glances; waving is her form. The lustre of day
sparkles from her forehead, and by the dark
shades of her curling ringlets night itself is driven
away!’”.... They who lose at love? Upon what
quest must the wretched ones go? And Khalil
Khayyat had said that the Thing was to be found
in this place.... Salim Awad’s lips trembled:
because of the loneliness of this death—and because
of the desert, gloomy and infinite, lying
beyond.
</p>
<p>
“Tom-ee,” Salim Awad repeated, smiling
now, “I am—mus’—go. Goo’-bye, Tom-ee!”
</p>
<p>
“No, no!”
</p>
<p>
In this hoarse, gasping protest Salim Awad
perceived rare sweetness. He smiled again—delight,
approval. “Ver’ much ’bliged,” he said,
politely. Then he rolled off into the water....
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>
One night in winter the wind, driving up from
the Battery, whipped a gray, soggy snow past the
door of Nageeb Fiani’s pastry-shop in Washington
Street. The shop was a cosey shelter from
the weather; and in the outer room, now crowded
with early idlers, they were preaching revolution
and the shedding of blood—boastful voices,
raised to the falsetto of shallow passion. Khalil
Khayyat, knowing well that the throne of Abdul-Hamid
would not tremble to the talk of Washington
Street, sat unheeding in the little back room;
and the coal on the narghile was glowing red,
and the coffee was steaming on the round table,
and a cloud of fragrant smoke was in the air.
In the big, black book, lying open before the
poet, were to be found, as always, the thoughts
of Abo Elola Elmoarri.
</p>
<p>
Tanous, the newsboy—the son of Yusef, the
father of Samara, by many called Abosamara—threw
<em>Kawkab Elhorriah</em> on the cook’s
counter.
</p>
<p>
“News of death!” cried he, as he hurried importantly
on. “<em>Kawkab</em>! News of death!”
</p>
<p>
The words caught the ear of Khalil Khayyat.
“News of death?” mused he. “It is a massacre
in Armenia.” He turned again, with a hopeless
sigh, to the big, black book.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
</p>
<p>
“News of death!” cried Nageeb Fiani, in the
outer room. “What is this?”
</p>
<p>
The death of Salim Awad: being communicated,
as the editor made known, by one who knew,
and had so informed an important person at St.
John’s, who had despatched the news south
from that far place to Washington Street.... And
when Nageeb Fiani had learned the manner of
the death of Salim Awad, he made haste to
Khalil Khayyat, holding <em>Kawkab Elhorriah</em> open
in his, hand.
</p>
<p>
“There is news of death, O Khalil!” said he.
</p>
<p>
“Ah,” Khayyat answered, with his long finger
marking the place in the big, black book, “there
has been a massacre in Armenia. God will yet
punish the murderer.”
</p>
<p>
“No, Khalil.”
</p>
<p>
Khayyat looked up in alarm. “The Turks
have not shed blood in Beirut?”
</p>
<p>
“No, Khalil.”
</p>
<p>
“Not so? Ah, then the mother of Shishim
has been cast into prison because of the sedition
uttered by her son in this place; and she has there
died.”
</p>
<p>
“No, Khalil.”
</p>
<p>
“Nageeb,” Khayyat demanded, quietly, “of
whom is this sad news spoken?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
</p>
<p>
“The news is from the north.”
</p>
<p>
Khayyat closed the book. He sipped his coffee,
touched the coal on the narghile and puffed it
to a glow, contemplated the gaudy wall-paper,
watched a spider pursue a patient course toward
the ceiling; at last opened the big, black book, and
began to turn the leaves with aimless, nervous
fingers. Nageeb stood waiting for the poet to
speak; and in the doorway, beyond, the people
from the outer room had gathered, waiting also
for words to fall from the lips of this man; for
the moment was great, and the poet was great.
</p>
<p>
“Salim Awad,” Khayyat muttered, “is dead.”
</p>
<p>
“Salim is dead. He died that a little one
might live.”
</p>
<p>
“That a little one might live?”
</p>
<p>
“Even so, Khalil—that a child might have
life.”
</p>
<p>
Khayyat smiled. “The quest is ended,” he
said. “It is well that Salim is dead.”
</p>
<p>
It is well? The people marvelled that Khalil
Khayyat should have spoken these cruel words.
It is well? And Khalil Khayyat had said so?
</p>
<p>
“That Salim should die in the cold water?”
Nageeb Fiani protested.
</p>
<p>
“That Salim should die—the death that he
did. It is well.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
</p>
<p>
The word was soon to be spoken; out of the
mind and heart of Khalil Khayyat, the poet,
great wisdom would appear. There was a
crowding at the door: the people pressed closer
that no shade of meaning might be lost; the dark
faces turned yet more eager; the silence deepened,
until the muffled rattle of trucks, lumbering
through the snowy night, and the roar of the
Elevated train were plain to be heard. What
would the poet say? What word of eternal
truth would he speak?
</p>
<p>
“It is well?” Nageeb Fiani whispered.
</p>
<p>
“It is well.”
</p>
<p>
The time was not yet come. The people still
crowded, still shuffled—still breathed. The poet
waited, having the patience of poets.
</p>
<p>
“Tell us, O Khalil!” Nageeb Fiani implored.
</p>
<p>
“They who lose at love,” said Khalil Khayyat,
fingering the leaves of the big, black book, “must
patiently seek some high death.”
</p>
<p>
Then the people knew, beyond peradventure,
that Khalil Khayyat was indeed a great poet.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>IX—THE REVOLUTION AT SATAN’S TRAP</h2>
<p>
Jehoshaphat Rudd of Satan’s Trap was
shy—able-bodied, to be sure, if a gigantic
frame means anything, and mature, if a family
of nine is competent evidence, but still as shy as
a child. Moreover, he had the sad habit of anxiety:
whence tense eyelids, an absent, poignant
gaze, a perpetual pucker between the brows.
His face was brown and big, framed in tawny,
soft hair and beard, and spread with a delicate
web of wrinkles, spun by the weather—a round
countenance, simple, kindly, apathetic. The
wind had inflamed the whites of his eyes and
turned the rims blood red; but the wells in the
midst were deep and clear and cool. Reserve,
courageous and methodical diligence at the fishing,
a quick, tremulous concern upon salutation—by
these signs the folk of his harbor had long
ago been persuaded that he was a fool; and a fool
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
he was, according to the convention of the Newfoundland
outports: a shy, dull fellow, whose
interests were confined to his punt, his gear, the
grounds off the Tombstone, and the bellies of his
young ones. He had no part with the disputatious
of Satan’s Trap: no voice, for example, in the
rancorous discussions of the purposes and ways
of the Lord God Almighty, believing the purposes
to be wise and kind, and the ways the Lord’s own
business. He was shy, anxious, and preoccupied;
wherefore he was called a fool, and made no answer:
for doubtless he <em>was</em> a fool. And what did
it matter? He would fare neither better nor worse.
</p>
<p>
Nor would Jehoshaphat wag a tongue with the
public-spirited men of Satan’s Trap: the times
and the customs had no interest, no significance,
for him; he was troubled with his own concerns.
Old John Wull, the trader, with whom (and no
other) the folk might barter their fish, personified
all the abuses, as a matter of course. But—
</p>
<p>
“I ’low I’m too busy t’ think,” Jehoshaphat
would reply, uneasily. “I’m too busy. I—I—why,
I got t’ tend my <em>fish!</em>”
</p>
<p>
This was the quality of his folly.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
It chanced one summer dawn, however, when
the sky was flushed with tender light, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
shadows were trooping westward, and the sea
was placid, that the punts of Timothy Yule and
Jehoshaphat Rudd went side by side to the Tombstone
grounds. It was dim and very still upon
the water, and solemn, too, in that indifferent
vastness between the gloom and the rosy, swelling
light. Satan’s Trap lay behind in the shelter
and shadow of great hills laid waste—a lean, impoverished,
listless home of men.
</p>
<p>
“You dunderhead!” Timothy Yule assured
Jehoshaphat. “He’ve been robbin’ you.”
</p>
<p>
“Maybe,” said Jehoshaphat, listlessly. “I been
givin’ the back kitchen a coat o’ lime, an’ I isn’t
had no time t’ give t’ thinkin’.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ he’ve been robbin’ this harbor for forty
year.”
</p>
<p>
“Dear man!” Jehoshaphat exclaimed, in dull
surprise. “Have he told you that?”
</p>
<p>
“Told me!” cried Timothy. “No,” he added,
with bitter restraint; “he’ve not.”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat was puzzled. “Then,” said he,
“how come you t’ know?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, they <em>says</em> so.”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat’s reply was gently spoken, a compassionate
rebuke. “An I was you, Timothy,”
said he, “I wouldn’t be harsh in judgment. ’Tisn’t
quite Christian.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
“My God!” ejaculated the disgusted Timothy.
</p>
<p>
After that they pulled in silence for a time.
Jehoshaphat’s face was averted, and Timothy
was aware of having, in a moment of impatience,
not only committed a strategic indiscretion, but
of having betrayed his innermost habit of profanity.
The light grew and widened and yellowed;
the cottages of Satan’s Trap took definite
outline, the hills their ancient form, the sea
its familiar aspect. Sea and sky and distant
rock were wide awake and companionably smiling.
The earth was blue and green and yellow,
a glittering place.
</p>
<p>
“Look you! Jehoshaphat,” Timothy demanded;
“is you in debt?”
</p>
<p>
“I is.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ is you ever been out o’ debt?”
</p>
<p>
“I isn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“How come you t’ know?”
</p>
<p>
“Why,” Jehoshaphat explained, “Mister Wull
<em>told</em> me so. An’ whatever,” he qualified, “father
was in debt when he died, an’ Mister Wull told
me I ought t’ pay. Father was <em>my</em> father,”
Jehoshaphat argued, “an’ I ’lowed I <em>would</em> pay.
For,” he concluded, “’twas right.”
</p>
<p>
“Is he ever give you an account?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, no—no, he haven’t. But it wouldn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
do no good, for I’ve no learnin’, an’ can’t
read.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” Timothy burst out, “an’ he isn’t give
nobody no accounts.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Jehoshaphat apologized, “he’ve a good
deal on his mind, lookin’ out for the wants of
us folk. He’ve a <em>wonderful</em> lot o’ brain labor.
He’ve all them letters t’ write t’ St. John’s, an’
he’ve got a power of ’rithmetic t’ do, an’ he’ve got
the writin’ in them big books t’ trouble un, an’—”
</p>
<p>
Timothy sneered.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, well,” sighed Jehoshaphat, “an I was
you, Timothy, I wouldn’t be harsh in judgment.”
</p>
<p>
Timothy laughed uproariously.
</p>
<p>
“Not harsh,” Jehoshaphat repeated, quietly—“not
in judgment.”
</p>
<p>
“Damn un!” Timothy cursed between his
teeth. “The greedy squid, the devil-fish’s spawn,
with his garden an’ his sheep an’ his cow! <em>You</em>
got a cow, Jehoshaphat? <em>You</em> got turnips an’
carrots? <em>You</em> got ol’ Bill Lutt t’ gather soil, an’
plant, an’ dig, an’ weed, while you smokes plug-cut
in the sunshine? Where’s <em>your</em> garden, Jehoshaphat?
Where’s <em>your</em> onions? The green
lumpfish! An’ where do he get his onions, an’
where do he get his soup, an’ where do he get his
cheese an’ raisins? ’Tis out o’ you an’ me an’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
all the other poor folk o’ Satan’s Trap. ’Tis
from the fish, an’ <em>he</em> never cast a line. ’Tis
from the fish that we takes from the grounds while
he squats like a lobster in the red house an’ in
the shop. An’ he gives less for the fish ’n he
gets, an’ he gets more for the goods an’ grub ’n
he gives. The thief, the robber, the whale’s
pup! Is you able, Jehoshaphat, t’ have the doctor
from Sniffle’s Arm for <em>your</em> woman! Is <em>you</em>
able t’ feed <em>your</em> kids with cow’s milk an’ baby-food?”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat mildly protested that he had not
known the necessity.
</p>
<p>
“An’ what,” Timothy proceeded, “is you ever
got from the grounds but rheumatiz an’ salt-water
sores?”
</p>
<p>
“I got enough t’ eat,” said Jehoshaphat.
</p>
<p>
Timothy was scornful.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Jehoshaphat argued, in defence of
himself, “the world have been goin’ for’ard a
wonderful long time at Satan’s Trap, an’ nobody
else haven’t got no more’n just enough.”
</p>
<p>
“Enough!” Timothy fumed. “’Tis kind o’
the Satan’s Trap trader t’ give you that! <em>I’ll</em> tell
un,” he exploded; “I’ll give un a piece o’ my
mind afore I dies.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t!” Jehoshaphat pleaded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
</p>
<p>
Timothy snorted his indignation.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t be rash,” said Jehoshaphat.
“Maybe,” he warned, “he’d not take your fish
no more. An’ maybe he’d close the shop an’ go
away.”
</p>
<p>
“Jus’ you wait,” said Timothy.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you do it, lad!” Jehoshaphat begged.
“’Twould make such a wonderful fuss in the
world!”
</p>
<p>
“An’ would you think o’ that?”
</p>
<p>
“I isn’t got <em>time</em> t’ think,” Jehoshaphat complained.
“I’m busy. I ’low I got my fish t’ cotch
an’ cure. I isn’t got time. I—I—I’m too busy.”
</p>
<p>
They were on the grounds. The day had
broken, a blue, serene day, knowing no disquietude.
They cast their grapnels overside, and
they fished until the shadows had fled around the
world and were hurrying out of the east. And
they reeled their lines, and stowed the fish, and
patiently pulled toward the harbor tickler, talking
not at all of the Satan’s Trap trader, but only of
certain agreeable expectations which the young
Timothy had been informed he might entertain
with reasonable certainty.
</p>
<p>
“I ’low,” said Jehoshaphat, when they were
within the harbor, “I understand. I got the hang
of it,” he repeated, with a little smile, “now.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
</p>
<p>
“Of what?” Timothy wondered.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Jehoshaphat explained, “’tis your
first.”
</p>
<p>
This was a sufficient explanation of Timothy’s
discontent. Jehoshaphat remembered that he,
too, had been troubled, fifteen years ago, when
the first of the nine had brought the future to his
attention. He was more at ease when this enlightenment
came.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Old John Wull was a gray, lean little widower,
with a bald head, bowed legs, a wide, straight,
thin-lipped mouth, and shaven, ashy cheeks. His
eyes were young enough, blue and strong and
quick, often peering masterfully through the
bushy brows, which he could let drop like a curtain.
In contrast with the rugged hills and
illimitable sea and stout men of Satan’s Trap, his
body was withered and contemptibly diminutive.
His premises occupied a point of shore within the
harbor—a wharf, a storehouse, a shop, a red
dwelling, broad drying-flakes, and a group of
out-buildings, all of which were self-sufficient and
proud, and looked askance at the cottages that
lined the harbor shore and strayed upon the hills
beyond.
</p>
<p>
It was his business to supply the needs of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
folk in exchange for the fish they took from the
sea—the barest need, the whole of the catch.
Upon this he insisted, because he conscientiously
believed, in his own way, that upon the fruits of
toil commercial enterprise should feed to satiety,
and cast the peelings and cores into the back
yard for the folk to nose like swine.
</p>
<p>
Thus he was accustomed to allow the fifty
illiterate, credulous families of Satan’s Trap
sufficient to keep them warm and to quiet their
stomachs, but no more; for, he complained:
“Isn’t they got enough on their backs?” and,
“Isn’t they got enough t’ eat?” and, “Lord!”
said he, “they’ll be wantin’ figs an’ joolry next.”
</p>
<p>
There were times when he trembled for the
fortune he had gathered in this way—in years
when there were no fish, and he must feed the
men and women and human litters of the Trap
for nothing at all, through which he was courageous,
if niggardly. When the folk complained
against him, he wondered, with a righteous wag
of the head, what would become of them if he
should vanish with his property and leave them
to fend for themselves. Sometimes he reminded
them of this possibility; and then they got afraid,
and thought of their young ones, and begged him
to forget their complaint. His only disquietude was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
the fear of hell: whereby he was led to
pay the wage of a succession of parsons, if they
preached comforting doctrine and blue-pencilled
the needle’s eye from the Testament; but not
otherwise. By some wayward, compelling sense
of moral obligation, he paid the school-teacher,
invariably, generously, so that the little folk of
Satan’s Trap might learn to read and write in
the winter months. ’Rithmetic he condemned,
but tolerated, as being some part of that unholy,
imperative thing called l’arnin’; but he had no
feeling against readin’ and writin’.
</p>
<p>
There was no other trader within thirty miles.
</p>
<p>
“They’ll trade with me,” John Wull would
say to himself, and be comforted, “or they’ll
starve.”
</p>
<p>
It was literally true.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
In that winter certain gigantic forces, with
which old John Wull had nothing whatever to
do, were inscrutably passionate. They went their
way, in some vast, appalling quarrel, indifferent
to the consequences. John Wull’s soul, money,
philosophy, the hopes of Satan’s Trap, the various
agonies of the young, were insignificant.
Currents and winds and frost had no knowledge
of them. It was a late season: the days were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
gray and bitter, the air was frosty, the snow lay
crisp and deep in the valleys, the harbor water
was frozen. Long after the time for blue winds
and yellow hills the world was still sullen and
white. Easterly gales, blowing long and strong,
swept the far outer sea of drift-ice—drove it in
upon the land, pans and bergs, and heaped it
against the cliffs. There was no safe exit from
Satan’s Trap. The folk were shut in by ice and
an impassable wilderness. This was not by the
power or contriving of John Wull: the old man had
nothing to do with it; but he compelled the season,
impiously, it may be, into conspiracy with
him. By-and-by, in the cottages, the store of
food, which had seemed sufficient when the first
snow flew, was exhausted. The flour-barrels of
Satan’s Trap were empty. Full barrels were in
the storehouse of John Wull, but in no other
place. So it chanced that one day, in a swirling
fall of snow, Jehoshaphat Rudd came across the
harbor with a dog and a sled.
</p>
<p>
John Wull, from the little office at the back of
the shop, where it was warm and still, watched
the fisherman breast the white wind.
</p>
<p>
“Mister Wull,” said Jehoshaphat, when he
stood in the office, “I ’low I’ll be havin’ another
barrel o’ flour.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
</p>
<p>
Wull frowned.
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” Jehoshaphat repeated, perplexed; “another
barrel.”
</p>
<p>
Wull pursed his lips.
</p>
<p>
“O’ flour,” said Jehoshaphat, staring.
</p>
<p>
The trader drummed on the desk and gazed
out of the window. He seemed to forget that
Jehoshaphat Rudd stood waiting. Jehoshaphat
felt awkward and out of place; he smoothed his
tawny beard, cracked his fingers, scratched his
head, shifted from one foot to the other. Some
wonder troubled him, then some strange alarm.
He had never before realized that the lives of his
young were in the keeping of this man.
</p>
<p>
“Flour,” he ventured, weakly—“one barrel.”
</p>
<p>
Wull turned. “It’s gone up,” said he.
</p>
<p>
“Have it, now!” Jehoshaphat exclaimed. “I
’lowed last fall, when I paid eight,” he proceeded,
“that she’d clumb as high as she could get
’ithout fallin’. But she’ve gone up, says you?
Dear man!”
</p>
<p>
“Sky high,” said the trader.
</p>
<p>
“Dear man!”
</p>
<p>
The stove was serene and of good conscience.
It labored joyously in response to the clean-souled
wind. For a moment, while the trader
watched the snow through his bushy brows and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
Jehoshaphat Rudd hopelessly scratched his head,
its hearty, honest roar was the only voice lifted
in the little office at the back of John Wull’s
shop.
</p>
<p>
“An’ why?” Jehoshaphat timidly asked.
</p>
<p>
“Scarcity.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” said Jehoshaphat, as though he understood.
He paused. “Isn’t you got as much
as you <em>had?</em>” he inquired.
</p>
<p>
The trader nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t you got enough in the storehouse t’ last
till the mail-boat runs?”
</p>
<p>
“Plenty, thank God!”
</p>
<p>
“Scarcity,” Jehoshaphat mused. “Mm-m-m!
Oh, I <em>sees</em>,” he added, vacantly. “Well, Mister
Wull,” he sighed, “I ’low I’ll take one of Early
Rose an’ pay the rise.”
</p>
<p>
Wull whistled absently.
</p>
<p>
“Early Rose,” Jehoshaphat repeated, with a
quick, keen glance of alarm.
</p>
<p>
The trader frowned.
</p>
<p>
“Rose,” Jehoshaphat muttered. He licked
his lips. “Of Early,” he reiterated, in a gasp,
“Rose.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, Jehoshaphat.”
</p>
<p>
Down came the big key from the nail. Jehoshaphat’s
round face beamed. The trader
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
slapped his ledger shut, moved toward the door,
but stopped dead, and gazed out of the window,
while his brows fell over his eyes, and he fingered
the big key.
</p>
<p>
“Gone up t’ eighteen,” said he, without turning.
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat stared aghast.
</p>
<p>
“Wonderful high for flour,” the trader continued,
in apologetic explanation; “but flour’s
wonderful scarce.”
</p>
<p>
“Tisn’t <em>right!</em>” Jehoshaphat declared. “Eighteen
dollars a barrel for Early Rose? ’Tisn’t
right!”
</p>
<p>
The key was restored to the nail.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t pay it, Mister Wull. No, no, man,
I can’t do it. Eighteen! Mercy o’ God! ’Tisn’t
right! ’Tis too <em>much</em> for Early Rose.”
</p>
<p>
The trader wheeled.
</p>
<p>
“An’ I <em>won’t</em> pay it,” said Jehoshaphat.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t have to,” was the placid reply.
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat started. Alarm—a sudden vision
of his children—quieted his indignation. “But,
Mister Wull, sir,” he pleaded, “I got t’ have it.
I—why—I just <em>got</em> t’ have it!”
</p>
<p>
The trader was unmoved.
</p>
<p>
“Eighteen!” cried Jehoshaphat, flushing.
“Mercy o’ God! I says ’tisn’t right.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tis the price.”
</p>
<p>
“’Tisn’t right!”
</p>
<p>
Wull’s eyes were how flashing. His lips were
drawn thin over his teeth. His brows had fallen
again. From the ambush they made he glared
at Jehoshaphat.
</p>
<p>
“I say,” said he, in a passionless voice, “that
the price o’ flour at Satan’s Trap is this day
eighteen.”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat was in woful perplexity.
</p>
<p>
“Eighteen,” snapped Wull. “Hear me?”
</p>
<p>
They looked into each other’s eyes. Outside
the storm raged, a clean, frank passion; for nature
is a fair and honest foe. In the little office
at the back of John Wull’s shop the withered
body of the trader shook with vicious anger.
Jehoshaphat’s round, brown, simple face was
gloriously flushed; his head was thrown back,
his shoulders were squared, his eyes were sure
and fearless.
</p>
<p>
“’Tis robbery!” he burst out.
</p>
<p>
Wull’s wrath exploded. “You bay-noddy!”
he began; “you pig of a punt-fisherman; you
penniless, ragged fool; you man without a copper;
you sore-handed idiot! What you whinin’ about?
What right <em>you</em> got t’ yelp in my office?”
</p>
<p>
Of habit Jehoshaphat quailed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
</p>
<p>
“If you don’t want my flour,” roared Wull,
fetching the counter a thwack with his white fist,
“leave it be! ’Tis mine, isn’t it? I <em>paid</em> for it.
I <em>got</em> it. There’s a law in this land, you pauper,
that <em>says</em> so. There’s a law. Hear me? There’s
a law, Mine, mine!” he cried, in a frenzy, lifting
his lean arms. “What I got is mine. I’ll eat
it,” he fumed, “or I’ll feed my pigs with it, or
I’ll spill it for the fishes. They isn’t no law t’
make me sell t’ <em>you</em>. An’ you’ll pay what I’m
askin’, or you’ll starve.”
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t do that, sir,” Jehoshaphat
gently protested. “Oh no—<em>no</em>! Ah, now, you
wouldn’t do that. You wouldn’t throw it t’ the
fishes, would you? Not flour! ’Twould be a
sinful waste.”
</p>
<p>
“Tis my right.”
</p>
<p>
“Ay,’ Mister Wull,” Jehoshaphat argued, with
a little smile, “’tis yours, I’ll admit; but we been
sort o’ dependin’ on you t’ lay in enough t’ get
us through the winter.”
</p>
<p>
WUll’s response was instant and angry. “Get
you out o’ my shop,” said he, “an’ come back
with a civil tongue!”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go, Mister Wull,” said Jehoshaphat,
quietly, picking at a thread in his faded cap.
“I’ll go. Ay, I’ll go. But—I got t’ have the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
flour. I—I—just <em>got</em> to. But I won’t pay,” he
concluded, “no eighteen dollars a barrel.”
</p>
<p>
The trader laughed.
</p>
<p>
“For,” said Jehoshaphat, “’tisn’t right.”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat went home without the flour,
complaining of the injustice.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Jehoshaphat Rudd would have no laughter in
the house, no weeping, no questions, no noise of
play. For two days he sat brooding by the
kitchen fire. His past of toil and unfailing recompense,
the tranquil routine of life, was
strangely like a dream, far off, half forgot. As a
reality it had vanished. Hitherto there had been
no future; there was now no past, no ground for
expectation. He must, at least, take time to
think, have courage to judge, the will to retaliate.
It was more important, more needful, to sit in
thought, with idle hands, than to mend the rent
in his herring seine. He was mystified and deeply
troubled.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes by day Jehoshaphat strode to the
window and looked out over the harbor ice to
the point of shore where stood the storehouse and
shop and red dwelling of old John Wull. By
night he drew close to the fire, and there sat
with his face in his hands; nor would he go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
to bed, nor would he speak, nor would he
move.
</p>
<p>
In the night of the third day the children awoke
and cried for food. Jehoshaphat rose from his
chair, and stood shaking, with breath suspended,
hands clinched, eyes wide. He heard their
mother rise and go crooning from cot to cot.
Presently the noise was hushed: sobs turned to
whimpers, and whimpers to plaintive whispers,
and these complaints to silence. The house was
still; but Jehoshaphat seemed all the while to hear
the children crying in the little rooms above,
He began to pace the floor, back and forth, back
and forth, now slow, now in a fury, now with listless
tread. And because his children had cried
for food in the night the heart of Jehoshaphat
Rudd was changed. From the passion of those
hours, at dawn, he emerged serene, and went to
bed.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
At noon of that day Jehoshaphat Rudd was
in the little office at the back of the shop. John
Wull was alone, perched on a high stool at the
desk, a pen in hand, a huge book open before
him.
</p>
<p>
“I’m come, sir,” said Jehoshaphat, “for the
barrel o’ flour.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
</p>
<p>
The trader gave him no attention.
</p>
<p>
“I’m come, sir,” Jehoshaphat repeated, his
voice rising a little, “for the flour.”
</p>
<p>
The trader dipped his pen in ink.
</p>
<p>
“I says, sir,” said Jehoshaphat, laying a hand
with some passion upon the counter, “that I’m
come for that there barrel o’ flour.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ I s’pose,” the trader softly inquired,
eying the page of his ledger more closely, “that
you thinks you’ll get it, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Ay, sir.”
</p>
<p>
Wull dipped his pen and scratched away.
</p>
<p>
“Mister Wull!”
</p>
<p>
The trader turned a leaf.
</p>
<p>
“Mister Wull,” Jehoshaphat cried, angrily, “I
wants flour. Is you gone deaf overnight?”
</p>
<p>
Impertinent question and tone of voice made
old John Wull wheel on the stool. In the forty
years he had traded at Satan’s Trap he had never
before met with impertinence that was not
timidly offered. He bent a scowling face upon
Jehoshaphat. “An’ you thinks,” said he, “that
you’ll get it?”
</p>
<p>
“I does.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you does, does you?”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat nodded.
</p>
<p>
“It all depends,” said Wull. “You’re wonderful deep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
in debt, Jehoshaphat.” The trader
had now command of himself. “I been lookin’
up your account,” he went on, softly. “You’re so
wonderful far behind, Jehoshaphat, on account
o’ high livin’ an’ Christmas presents, that I been
thinkin’ I might do the business a injury by givin’
you more credit. I can’t think o’ <em>myself</em>, Jehoshaphat,
in this matter. ’Tis a <em>business</em> matter;
an’ I got t’ think o’ the business. You sees,
Jehoshaphat, eighteen dollars more credit—”
</p>
<p>
“Eight,” Jehoshaphat corrected.
</p>
<p>
“Eighteen,” the trader insisted.
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat said nothing, nor did his face express
feeling. He was looking stolidly at the
big key of the storehouse.
</p>
<p>
“The flour depends,” Wull proceeded, after
a thoughtful pause, through which he had regarded
the gigantic Jehoshaphat with startled curiosity,
“on what I thinks the business will stand in
the way o’ givin’ more credit t’ you.”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir,” said Jehoshaphat.
</p>
<p>
Wull put down his pen, slipped from the high
stool, and came close to Jehoshaphat. He was
mechanical and slow in these movements, as
though all at once perplexed, given some new
view, which disclosed many and strange possibilities.
For a moment he leaned against the counter, legs crossed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
staring at the floor, with his
long, scrawny right hand smoothing his cheek
and chin. It was quiet in the office, and warm,
and well-disposed, and sunlight came in at the
window.
</p>
<p>
Soon the trader stirred, as though awakening.
“You was sayin’ eight, wasn’t you?” he asked,
without looking up.
</p>
<p>
“Eight, sir.”
</p>
<p>
The trader pondered this. “An’ how,” he
inquired, at last, “was you makin’ that out?”
</p>
<p>
“Tis a fair price.”
</p>
<p>
Wull smoothed his cheek and chin. “Ah!”
he murmured. He mused, staring at the floor,
his restless fingers beating a tattoo on his teeth.
He had turned woebegone and very pale. “Jehoshaphat,”
he asked, turning upon the man,
“would you mind tellin’ me just how you’re
’lowin’ t’ get my flour against my will?”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat looked away.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like t’ know,” said Wull, “if you wouldn’t
mind tellin’ me.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” Jehoshaphat answered. “No, Mister
Wull—I wouldn’t mind tellin’.”
</p>
<p>
“Then,” Wull demanded, “how?”
</p>
<p>
“Mister Wull,” Jehoshaphat explained, “I’m
a bigger man than you.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
</p>
<p>
It was very quiet in the office. The wind had
gone down in the night, the wood in the stove was
burned to glowing coals. It was very, very
still in old John Wull’s office at the back of the
shop, and old John Wull turned away, and went
absently to the desk, where he fingered the
leaves of his ledger, and dipped his pen in ink,
but did not write. There was a broad window
over the desk, looking out upon the harbor;
through this, blankly, he watched the children at
play on the ice, but did not see them. By-and-by,
when he had closed the book and put the
desk in order, he came back to the counter, leaned
against it, crossed his legs, began to smooth his
chin, while he mused, staring at the square of sunlight
on the floor. Jehoshaphat could not look
at him. The old man’s face was so gray and
drawn, so empty of pride and power, his hand
so thin and unsteady, his eyes so dull, so deep
in troubled shadows, that Jehoshaphat’s heart
ached. He wished that the world had gone on
in peace, that the evil practices of the great were
still hid from his knowledge, that there had been
no vision, no call to revolution; he rebelled against
the obligation upon him, though it had come to
him as a thing that was holy. He regretted his
power, had shame, indeed, because of the ease
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
with which the mighty could be put down. He
felt that he must be generous, tender, that he
must not misuse his strength.
</p>
<p>
The patch of yellow light had perceptibly
moved before the trader spoke. “Jehoshaphat,”
he asked, “you know much about law?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, no, Mister Wull,” Jehoshaphat answered,
with simple candor; “not <em>too</em> much.”
</p>
<p>
“The law will put you in jail for this.”
</p>
<p>
Constables and jails were like superstitious
terrors to Jehoshaphat. He had never set eyes
on the brass buttons and stone walls of the law.
</p>
<p>
“Oh no—<em>no</em>!” he protested. “He wouldn’t!
Not in <em>jail</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“The law,” Wull warned, with grim delight,
“will put you in jail.”
</p>
<p>
“He <em>couldn’t</em>!” Jehoshaphat complained. “As I
takes it, the law sees fair play atween men. That’s
what he was <em>made</em> for. I ’low he ought t’ put you
in jail for raisin’ the price o’ flour t’ eighteen; but
not me—not for what I’m bound t’ do, Mister
Wull, law or no law, as God lives! ’Twouldn’t
be right, sir, if he put me in jail for that.”
</p>
<p>
“The law will.”
</p>
<p>
“But,” Jehoshaphat still persisted, doggedly,
“’twouldn’t be <em>right</em>!’
</p>
<p>
The trader fell into a muse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’m come,” Jehoshaphat reminded him, “for
the flour.”
</p>
<p>
“You can’t have it.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear!” Jehoshaphat sighed. “My, my!
Pshaw! I ’low, then, us’ll just have t’ <em>take</em> it.”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat went to the door of the shop.
It was cold and gloomy in the shop. He opened
the door. The public of Satan’s Trap, in the
persons of ten men of the place, fathers of families
(with the exception of Timothy Yule, who had
qualified upon his expectations), trooped over the
greasy floor, their breath cloudy in the frosty air,
and crowded into the little office, in the wake of
Jehoshaphat Rudd. They had the gravity of
mien, the set faces, the compassionate eyes, the
merciless purpose, of a jury. The shuffling subsided.
It was once more quiet in the little office.
Timothy Yule’s hatred got the better of his sense
of propriety: he laughed, but the laugh expired
suddenly, for Jehoshaphat Rudd’s hand fell with
unmistakable meaning upon his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
John Wull faced them.
</p>
<p>
“I ’low, Mister Wull,” said Jehoshaphat, diffidently,
“that we wants the storehouse key.”
</p>
<p>
The trader put the key in his pocket.
</p>
<p>
“The key,” Jehoshaphat objected; “we wants
that there key.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
</p>
<p>
“By the Almighty!” old John Wull snarled,
“you’ll all go t’ jail for this, if they’s a law in
Newfoundland.”
</p>
<p>
The threat was ignored.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t hurt un, lads,” Jehoshaphat cautioned;
“for he’s so wonderful tender. He’ve not been
bred the way <em>we</em> was. He’s wonderful old an’
lean an’ brittle,” he added, gently; “so I ’low
we’d best be careful.”
</p>
<p>
John Wull’s resistance was merely technical.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Mister Wull,” said Jehoshaphat, when
the big key was in his hand and the body of the
trader had been tenderly deposited in his chair
by the stove, “don’t you go an’ fret. We isn’t
the thieves that break in an’ steal nor the moths
that go an’ corrupt. We isn’t robbers, an’ we
isn’t mean men. We’re the public,” he explained,
impressively, “o’ Satan’s Trap. We got
together, Mister Wull,” he continued, feeling
some delight in the oratory which had been thrust
upon him, “an’ we ’lowed that flour was worth
about eight; but we’ll pay nine, for we got thinkin’
that if flour goes up an’ down, accordin’ t’ the
will o’ God, it ought t’ go up now, if ever, the
will o’ God bein’ a mystery, anyhow. We don’t
want you t’ close up the shop an’ go away, after
this, Mister Wull; for we got t’ have you, or some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
one like you, t’ do what you been doin’, so as we
can have minds free o’ care for the fishin’. If
they was anybody at Satan’s Trap that could read
an’ write like you, an’ knowed about money an’
prices—if they was anybody like that at Satan’s
Trap, willin’ t’ do woman’s work, which I doubts,
we wouldn’t care whether you went or stayed;
but they isn’t, an’ we can’t do ’ithout you. So
don’t you fret,” Jehoshaphat concluded. “You
set right there by the fire in this little office o’
yours. Tom Lower’ll put more billets on the
fire for you, an’ you’ll be wonderful comfortable
till we gets through. I’ll see that account is
kep’ by Tim Yule of all we takes. You can put
it on the books just when you likes. No hurry,
Mister Wull—no hurry. The prices will be
them that held in the fall o’ the year, ’cept flour,
which is gone up t’ nine by the barrel. An’, ah,
now, Mister Wull,” Jehoshaphat pleaded, “don’t
you have no hard feelin’. ’Twouldn’t be right;
We’re the public; so <em>please</em> don’t you go an’ have
no hard feelin’.”
</p>
<p>
The trader would say nothing.
</p>
<p>
“Now, lads,” said Jehoshaphat, “us’ll go.”
In the storehouse there were two interruptions
to the transaction of business in an orderly
fashion. Tom Lower, who was a lazy fellow and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
wasteful, as Jehoshaphat knew, demanded thirty
pounds of pork, and Jehoshaphat knocked him
down. Timothy Yule, the anarchist, proposed
to sack the place, and him Jehoshaphat knocked
down twice. There was no further difficulty.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Mister Wull,” said Jehoshaphat, as he
laid the key and the account on the trader’s
desk, “the public o’ Satan’s Trap is wonderful
sorry; but the thing had t’ be done.”
</p>
<p>
The trader would not look up.
</p>
<p>
“It makes such a wonderful fuss in the world,”
Jehoshaphat complained, “that the crew hadn’t
no love for the job. But it—it—it jus’ had t’ be
done.”
</p>
<p>
Old John Wull scowled.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
For a long time, if days may be long, Jehoshaphat
Rudd lived in the fear of constables and
jails, which were the law, to be commanded by
the wealth of old John Wull; and for the self-same
period—the days being longer because of the
impatience of hate—old John Wull lived in expectation
of his revenge. Jehoshaphat Rudd
lowed he’d stand by, anyhow, an’ <em>go</em> t’ jail, if
’twas needful t’ maintain the rights o’ man. Ay,
<em>he’d</em> go t’ jail, an’ be whipped an’ starved, as the
imagination promised, but he’d be jiggered if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
he’d “<em>’pologize</em>.” Old John Wull kept grim
watch upon the winds; for upon the way the wind
blew depended the movement of the ice, and the
clearing of the sea, and the first voyage of the
mail-boat. He was glad that he had been robbed;
so glad that he rubbed his lean, transparent
hands until the flush of life appeared to surprise
him; so glad that he chuckled until his housekeeper
feared his false teeth would by some
dreadful mischance vanish within him. Jail? ay,
he’d put Jehoshaphat Rudd in jail; but he would
forgive the others, that they might continue to
fish and to consume food. In jail, ecod! t’ be
fed on bread an’ water, t’ be locked up, t’ wear
stripes, t’ make brooms, t’ lie there so long that
the last little Rudd would find its own father
a stranger when ’twas all over with. ’Twould
be fair warning t’ the malcontent o’ the folk;
they would bide quiet hereafter. All the people
would toil and trade; they would complain no
more. John Wull was glad that the imprudence
of Jehoshaphat Rudd had provided him with
power to restore the ancient peace to Satan’s
Trap.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
One day in the spring, when the bergs and
great floes of the open had been blown to sea,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
and the snow was gone from the slopes of the
hills, and the sun was out, and the earth was
warm and yellow and merrily dripping, old John
Wull attempted a passage of the harbor by the
ice, which there had lingered, confined. It was
only to cross the narrows from Haul-Away Head
to Daddy Tool’s Point, no more than a stone’s
throw for a stout lad. The ice had been broken
into pans by a stiff breeze from the west, and was
then moving with the wind, close-packed, bound
out to sea, there to be dispersed and dissolved.
It ran sluggishly through the narrows, scraping
the rocks of the head and of the point; the heave
of the sea slipped underneath and billowed the
way, and the outermost pans of ice broke from
the press and went off with the waves. But the
feet of old John Wull were practised; he essayed
the crossing without concern—indeed, with an
absent mind. Presently he stopped to rest; and
he stared out to sea, musing; and when again he
looked about, the sea had softly torn the pan
from the pack.
</p>
<p>
Old John Wull was adrift, and bound out.
</p>
<p>
“Ahoy, you, Jehoshaphat!” he shouted. “Jehoshaphat!
Oh, Jehoshaphat!”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat came to the door of his cottage
on Daddy Tool’s Point.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
</p>
<p>
“Launch that rodney,”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Wull directed, “an’
put me on shore. An’ lively, man,” he complained.
“I’ll be cotchin’ cold out here.”
</p>
<p>
With the help of Timothy Yule, who chanced
to be gossiping in the kitchen, Jehoshaphat Rudd
got the rodney in the open water by the stage-head.
What with paddling and much hearty
hauling and pushing, they had the little craft
across the barrier of ice in the narrows before
the wind had blown old John Wull a generous
rod out to sea.
</p>
<p>
“Timothy, lad,” Jehoshaphat whispered, “I
’low you better stay here.”
</p>
<p>
Timothy kept to the ice.
</p>
<p>
“You been wonderful slow,” growled Wull.
“Come ’round t’ the lee side, you dunderhead!
Think I wants t’ get my feet wet?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir,” Jehoshaphat protested. “Oh no;
I wouldn’t have you do that an I could <em>help</em>
it.”
</p>
<p>
The harbor folk were congregating on Haul-Away
Head and Daddy Tool’s Point. ’Twas
an agreeable excitement to see John Wull in a
mess—in a ludicrous predicament, which made
him helpless before their eyes. They whispered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
they smiled behind their hands, they chuckled
inwardly.
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat pulled to the lee side of the pan.
</p>
<p>
“Come ’longside,” said Wull.
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat dawdled.
</p>
<p>
“Come ’longside, you fool!” Wull roared.
“Think I can leap three fathom?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir; oh no; no, indeed.”
</p>
<p>
“Then come ’longside.”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat sighed.
</p>
<p>
“Come in here, you crazy pauper!” Wull
screamed, stamping his rage. “Come in here
an’ put me ashore!”
</p>
<p>
“Mister Wull!”
</p>
<p>
Wull eyed the man in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“Labor,” said Jehoshaphat, gently, “is gone
up.”
</p>
<p>
Timothy Yule laughed, but on Haul-Away
Head and Daddy Tool’s Point the folk kept
silent; nor did old John Wull, on the departing
pan, utter a sound.
</p>
<p>
“Sky high,” Jehoshaphat concluded.
</p>
<p>
The sun was broadly, warmly shining, the sky
was blue; but the wind was rising smartly, and
far off over the hills of Satan’s Trap, beyond the
wilderness that was known, it was turning gray
and tumultuous. Old John Wull scowled, wheeled, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
looked away to sea; he did not see the
ominous color and writhing in the west.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t want no law, Mister Wull,” Jehoshaphat
continued, “at Satan’s Trap.”
</p>
<p>
Wull would not attend.
</p>
<p>
“Not law,” Jehoshaphat repeated; “for we
knows well enough at Satan’s Trap,” said he,
“what’s fair as atween men. You jus’ leave the
law stay t’ St. John’s, sir, where he’s t’ home.
He isn’t fair, by no means; an’ we don’t want un
here t’ make trouble.”
</p>
<p>
The trader’s back was still turned.
</p>
<p>
“An’, Mister Wull,” Jehoshaphat entreated,
his face falling like a child’s, “don’t you have no
hard feelin’ over this. Ah, now, <em>don’t</em>!” he
pleaded. “You won’t, will you? For we isn’t
got no hate for you, Mister Wull, an’ we isn’t
got no greed for ourselves. We just wants what’s
fair—just what’s fair.” He added: “Just on’y
that. We likes t’ see you have your milk an’
butter an’ fresh beef an’ nuts an’ whiskey. <em>We</em>
don’t want them things, for they isn’t ours by
rights. All we wants is just on’y fair play. We
don’t want no law, sir: for, ecod!” Jehoshaphat
declared, scratching his head in bewilderment,
“the law looks after them that <em>has</em>, so far as I
<em>knows</em>, sir, an’ don’t know nothin’ about them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
that <em>hasn’t</em>. An’ we don’t want un here at Satan’s
Trap. We won’t <em>have</em> un! We—we—why,
ecod! we—we can’t <em>’low</em> it! We’d be ashamed
of ourselves an we ’lowed you t’ fetch the law t’
Satan’s Trap t’ wrong us. We’re free men, isn’t
we?” he demanded, indignantly. “Isn’t we?
Ecod! I ’low we <em>is</em>! You think, John Wull,”
he continued, in wrath, “that <em>you</em> can do what you
like with <em>we</em> just because you an’ the likes o’ you
is gone an’ got a law? You can’t! You can’t!
An’ you can’t, just because we won’t <em>’low</em> it.”
</p>
<p>
It was an incendiary speech.
</p>
<p>
“No, you can’t!” Timothy Yule screamed
from the ice, “you robber, you thief, you whale’s
pup! <em>I’ll</em> tell you what I thinks o’ you. You
can’t scare <em>me</em>. I wants that meadow you stole
from my father. I wants that meadow—”
</p>
<p>
“Timothy,” Jehoshaphat interrupted, quietly,
“you’re a fool. Shut your mouth!”
</p>
<p>
Tom Lower, the lazy, wasteful Tom Lower,
ran down to the shore of Haul-Away Head, and
stamped his feet, and shook his fist. “I wants
your cow an’ your raisins an’ your candy! We
got you down, you robber! An’ I’ll <em>have</em> your
red house; I’ll have your wool blankets; I’ll have
your—”
</p>
<p>
“Tom Lower,” Jehoshaphat roared, rising in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
wrath, “I’ll floor you for that! That I will—next
time I cotch you out.”
</p>
<p>
John Wull turned half-way around and grinned.
</p>
<p>
“Mister Wull,” Jehoshaphat asked, propitiatingly,
“won’t you be put ashore?”
</p>
<p>
“Not at the price.”
</p>
<p>
“I ’low, then, sir,” said Jehoshaphat, in some
impatience, “that you might as well be comfortable
while you makes up your mind. Here!”
He cast a square of tarpaulin on the ice, and
chancing to discover Timothy Yule’s jacket, he
added that. “There!” he grunted, with satisfaction;
“you’ll be sittin’ soft an’ dry while you
does your thinkin’. Don’t be long, sir—not
overlong. <em>Please</em> don’t, sir,” he begged; “for
it looks t’ me—it looks wonderful t’ me—like
a spurt o’ weather.”
</p>
<p>
John Wull spread the tarpaulin.
</p>
<p>
“An’ when you gets through considerin’ of the
question,” said Jehoshaphat, suggestively, “an’
is come t’ my way o’ thinkin’, why all you got t’
do is lift your little finger, an’ I’ll put you ashore”—a
gust of wind whipped past—“if I’m able,”
Jehoshaphat added.
</p>
<p>
Pan and boat drifted out from the coast, a
slow course, which in an hour had reduced the
harbor folk to black pygmies on the low rocks to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
windward. Jehoshaphat paddled patiently in the
wake of the ice. Often he raised his head, in apprehension,
to read the signs in the west; and he
sighed a deal, and sometimes muttered to himself.
Old John Wull was squatted on the tarpaulin,
with Timothy Yule’s jacket for a cushion,
his great-coat wrapped close about him, his cap
pulled over his ears, his arms folded. The withered
old fellow was as lean and blue and rigid and
staring as a frozen corpse.
</p>
<p>
The wind had freshened. The look and smell
of the world foreboded a gale. Overhead the sky
turned gray. There came a shadow on the sea,
sullen and ominous. Gusts of wind ran offshore
and went hissing out to sea; and they left the
waters rippling black and flecked with froth
wherever they touched. In the west the sky,
far away, changed from gray to deepest black
and purple; and high up, midway, masses of
cloud, with torn and streaming edges, rose
swiftly toward the zenith. It turned cold. A
great flake of snow fell on Jehoshaphat’s cheek,
and melted; but Jehoshaphat was pondering
upon justice. He wiped the drop of water away
with the back of his hand, because it tickled him,
but gave the sign no heed.
</p>
<p>
“I ’low, Mister Wull,” said he, doggedly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
“that you better give Timothy Yule back his
father’s meadow. For nobody knows, sir,” he
argued, “why Timothy Yule’s father went an’
signed his name t’ that there writin’ just afore he
died. ’Twasn’t right. He didn’t ought t’ sign
it. An’ you got t’ give the meadow back.”
</p>
<p>
John Wull was unmoved.
</p>
<p>
“An’, look you! Mister Wull,” Jehoshaphat
continued, pulling closer to the pan, addressing
the bowed back of the trader, “you better not
press young Isaac Lower for that cod-trap money.
He’ve too much trouble with that wife o’ his t’
be bothered by debt. Anyhow, you ought t’
give un a chance. An’, look you! you better let
ol’ Misses Jowl have back her garden t’ Green
Cove. The way you got that, Mister Wull, is
queer. I don’t know, but I ’low you better give
it back, anyhow. You <em>got</em> to, Mister Wull;
an’, ecod! you got t’ give the ol’ woman a pound
o’ cheese an’ five cents’ worth—no, ten—ten
cents’ worth o’ sweets t’ make her feel good.
She <em>likes</em> cheese. She ’lows she never could get
<em>enough</em> o’ cheese. She ’lows she <em>wished</em> she could
have her fill afore she dies. An’ you got t’ give
her a whole pound for herself.”
</p>
<p>
They were drifting over the Tombstone grounds.
</p>
<p>
“Whenever you makes up your mind,” Jehoshaphat suggested,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
diffidently, “you lift your
little finger—jus’ your little finger.”
</p>
<p>
There was no response.
</p>
<p>
“Your little finger,” Jehoshaphat repeated.
“Jus’ your little finger—on’y that.”
</p>
<p>
Wull faced about. “Jehoshaphat,” said he,
with a grin, “you wouldn’t leave me.”
</p>
<p>
“Jus’ wouldn’t I!”
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t.”
</p>
<p>
“You jus’ wait and see.”
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t leave me,” said Wull, “because
you couldn’t. I knows you, Jehoshaphat—I
knows you.”
</p>
<p>
“You better look out.”
</p>
<p>
“Come, now, Jehoshaphat, is you goin’ t’
leave an old man drift out t’ sea an’ die?”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat was embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
“Eh, Jehoshaphat?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, no,” Jehoshaphat admitted, frankly.
“I isn’t; leastways, not alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Not alone?” anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“No; not alone. I’ll go with you, Mister
Wull, if you’re lonesome, an’ wants company.
You sees, sir, I can’t give in. I jus’ <em>can’t</em>! I’m
here, Mister Wull, in this here cranky rodney,
beyond the Tombstone grounds, with a dirty
gale from a point or two south o’ west about t’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
break, because I’m the public o’ Satan’s Trap.
I can die, sir, t’ save gossip; but I sim-plee jus’
isn’t able t’ give in. ’Twouldn’t be <em>right</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, <em>I</em> won’t give in.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor I, sir. So here we is—out here beyond
the Tombstone grounds, you on a pan an’ me
in a rodney. An’ the weather isn’t—well—not
quite <em>kind</em>.”
</p>
<p>
It was not. The black clouds, torn, streaming,
had possessed the sky, and the night was
near come. Haul-Away Head and Daddy Tool’s
Point had melted with the black line of coast.
Return—safe passage through the narrows to the
quiet water and warm lights of Satan’s Trap—was
almost beyond the most courageous hope.
The wind broke from the shore in straight lines—a
stout, agile wind, loosed for riot upon the sea.
The sea was black, with a wind-lop upon the
grave swell—a black-and-white sea, with spume
in the gray air. The west was black, with no
hint of other color—without the pity of purple or
red. Roundabout the sea was breaking, troubled
by the wind, indifferent to the white little rodney
and the lives o’ men.
</p>
<p>
“You better give in,” old John Wull warned.
</p>
<p>
“No,” Jehoshaphat answered; “no; oh no!
I won’t give in. Not <em>in</em>.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
</p>
<p>
A gust turned the black sea white.
</p>
<p>
“<em>You</em> better give in,” said Jehoshaphat.
</p>
<p>
John Wull shrugged his shoulders and turned
his back.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Mister Wull,” said Jehoshaphat, firmly,
“I ’low I can’t stand this much longer. I
’low we can’t be fools much longer an’ get back
t’ Satan’s Trap. I got a sail, here, Mister Wull;
but, ecod! the beat t’ harbor isn’t pleasant t’
<em>think</em> about.”
</p>
<p>
“You better go home,” sneered old John
Wull.
</p>
<p>
“I ’low I <em>will</em>,” Jehoshaphat declared.
</p>
<p>
Old John Wull came to the windward edge of
the ice, and there stood frowning, with his feet
submerged. “What was you sayin’?” he asked.
“That you’d go home?”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat looked away.
</p>
<p>
“An’ leave me?” demanded John Wull.
“Leave <em>me? Me?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“I got t’ think o’ my kids.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ you’d leave me t’ <em>die?</em>”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Jehoshaphat complained, “’tis long
past supper-time. You better give in.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t!”
</p>
<p>
The coast was hard to distinguish from the
black sky in the west. It began to snow. Snow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
and night, allied, would bring Jehoshaphat Rudd
and old John Wull to cold death.
</p>
<p>
“Mister Wull,” Jehoshaphat objected, “’tis
long past supper-time, an’ I wants t’ go home.”
</p>
<p>
“Go—an’ be damned!”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll count ten,” Jehoshaphat threatened.
</p>
<p>
“You dassn’t!”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know whether I’ll <em>go</em> or not,” said
Jehoshaphat. “Maybe not. Anyhow, I’ll count
ten, an’ see what happens. Is you ready?”
</p>
<p>
Wull sat down on the tarpaulin.
</p>
<p>
“One,” Jehoshaphat began.
</p>
<p>
John Wull seemed not to hear.
</p>
<p>
“Two,” said Jehoshaphat. “Three—four—five—six—seven.”
</p>
<p>
John Wull did not turn.
</p>
<p>
“Eight.”
</p>
<p>
There was no sign of relenting.
</p>
<p>
“Nine.”
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat paused. “God’s mercy!” he
groaned, “don’t you be a fool, Mister Wull,” he
pleaded. “Doesn’t you <em>know</em> what the weather is?”
</p>
<p>
A wave—the lop raised by the wind—broke
over the pan. John Wull stood up. There
came a shower of snow.
</p>
<p>
“Eh?” Jehoshaphat demanded, in agony.
</p>
<p>
“I won’t give in,” said old John Wull.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then I got t’ say ten. I jus’ <em>got</em> to.”
</p>
<p>
“I dare you.”
</p>
<p>
“I will, Mister Wull. Honest, I will! I’ll
say ten an you don’t look out.”
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you <em>do</em> it?”
</p>
<p>
“In a minute, Mister Wull. I’ll say it just
so soon as I get up the sail. I will, Mister Wull,
honest t’ God!”
</p>
<p>
The coast had vanished.
</p>
<p>
“Look,” cried Jehoshaphat, “we’re doomed
men!”
</p>
<p>
The squall, then first observed, sent the sea
curling over the ice. Jehoshaphat’s rodney
shipped the water it raised. Snow came in a
blinding cloud.
</p>
<p>
“Say ten, you fool!” screamed old John Wull.
</p>
<p>
“Ten!”
</p>
<p>
John Wull came to the edge of the pan.
’Twas hard for the old man to breast the gust.
He put his hands to his mouth that he might
be heard in the wind.
</p>
<p>
“I give in!” he shouted.
</p>
<p>
Jehoshaphat managed to save the lives of both.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Old John Wull, with his lean feet in a tub of
hot water, with a gray blanket over his shoulders,
with a fire sputtering in the stove, with his housekeeper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
hovering near—old John Wull chuckled.
The room was warm and his stomach was full,
and the wind, blowing horribly in the night, could
work him no harm. There he sat, sipping herb
tea to please his housekeeper, drinking whiskey
to please himself. He had no chill, no fever,
no pain; perceived no warning of illness. So he
chuckled away. It was all for the best. There
would now surely be peace at Satan’s Trap. Had
he not yielded? What more could they ask?
They would be content with this victory. For a
long, long time they would not complain. He
had yielded; very well: Timothy Yule should
have his father’s meadow, Dame Jowl her garden
and sweets and cheese, the young Lower be left
in possession of the cod-trap, and there would
be no law. Very well; the folk would neither
pry nor complain for a long, long time: that was
triumph enough for John Wull. So he chuckled
away, with his feet in hot water, and a gray
blanket about him, bald and withered and
ghastly, but still feeling the comfort of fire and
hot water and whiskey, the pride of power.
</p>
<p>
And within three years John Wull possessed
again all that he had yielded, and the world of
Satan’s Trap wagged on as in the days before
the revolution.

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>X—THE SURPLUS</h2>
<p>
To the east was the illimitable ocean, laid
thick with moonlight and luminous mist;
to the west, beyond a stretch of black, slow heaving
water, was the low line of Newfoundland, an
illusion of kindliness, the malignant character of
its jagged rock and barren interior transformed by
the gentle magic of the night. Tumm, the clerk,
had the wheel of the schooner, and had been
staring in a rapture at the stars.
</p>
<p>
“Jus’ readin’, sir,” he explained.
</p>
<p>
I wondered what he read.
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” he answered, turning again to contemplate
the starlit sky, “jus’ a little psa’m from
my Bible.”
</p>
<p>
I left him to read on, myself engaged with a
perusal of the serene and comforting text-book
of philosophy spread overhead. The night was
favorably inclined and radiant: a soft southerly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
wind blowing without menace, a sky of infinite
depth and tender shadow, the sea asleep under
the moon. With a gentle, aimlessly wandering
wind astern—an idle, dawdling, contemptuous
breeze, following the old craft lazily, now and
again whipping her nose under water to remind
her of suspended strength—the trader <em>Good
Samaritan</em> ran on, wing and wing, through the
moonlight, bound across from Sinners’ Tickle to
Afterward Bight, there to deal for the first of the
catch.
</p>
<p>
“Them little stars jus’ <em>will</em> wink!” Tumm
complained.
</p>
<p>
I saw them wink in despite.
</p>
<p>
“Ecod!” Tumm growled.
</p>
<p>
The amusement of the stars was not by this
altered to a more serious regard: everywhere they
winked.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve seed un peep through a gale o’ wind, a
slit in the black sky, a cruel, cold time,” Tumm
continued, a pretence of indignation in his voice,
“when ’twas a mean hard matter t’ keep a schooner
afloat in a dirty sea, with all hands wore out
along o’ labor an’ the fear o’ death an’ hell; an’,
ecod! them little cusses was winkin’ still. Eh?
What d’ye make o’ that?—winkin’ still, the
heartless little cusses!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
</p>
<p>
There were other crises, I recalled—knowing
little enough of the labor of the sea—upon which
they winked.
</p>
<p>
“Ay,” Tumm agreed; “they winks when lovers
kiss on the roads; an’ they winks jus’ the
same,” he added, softly, “when a heart breaks.”
</p>
<p>
“They’re humorous little beggars,” I observed.
</p>
<p>
Tumm laughed. “They been lookin’ at this
here damned thing so long,” he drawled—meaning,
no doubt, upon the spectacle of the world—“that
no wonder they winks!”
</p>
<p>
This prefaced a tale.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“Somehow,” Tumm began, his voice fallen
rather despondent, I fancied, but yet continuing
most curiously genial, “it always made me think
o’ dust an’ ashes t’ clap eyes on ol’ Bill Hulk o’
Gingerbread Cove. Ay, b’y; but I could jus’
fair hear the parson singsong that mean truth o’
life: ‘Dust t’ dust; ashes t’ ashes’—an’ make the
best of it, ye sinners an’ young folk! When ol’
Bill hove alongside, poor man! I’d think no
more o’ maids an’ trade, o’ which I’m fair sinful
fond, but on’y o’ coffins an’ graves an’ ground.
For, look you! the ol’ feller was so white an’
wheezy—so fishy-eyed an’ crooked an’ shaky
along o’ age. ’Tis a queer thing, sir, but, truth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
o’ God, so old was Bill Hulk that when he’d
board me I’d remember somehow the warm
breast o’ my mother, an’ then think, an’ couldn’t
help it, o’ the bosom o’ dust where my head must
lie.”
</p>
<p>
Tumm paused.
</p>
<p>
“Seemed t’ me, somehow,” he continued,
“when the <em>Quick as Wink</em> was lyin’ of a Sunday
t’ Gingerbread Cove—seemed t’ me somehow,
when I’d hear the church bell ring an’ echo
across the water an’ far into the hills—when I’d
cotch sight o’ ol’ Bill Hulk, with his staff an’ braw
black coat, crawlin’ down the hill t’ meetin’—ay,
an’ when the sun was out, warm an’ yellow, an’
the maids an’ lads was flirtin’ over the roads t’
hear the parson thunder agin their hellish levity—seemed
t’ me then, somehow, that ol’ Bill was
all the time jus’ dodgin’ along among open
graves; for, look you! the ol’ feller had such
trouble with his legs. An’ I’d wish by times that
he’d stumble an’ fall in, an’ be covered up in a
comfortable an’ decent sort o’ fashion, an’ stowed
away for good an’ all in the bed where he belonged.
</p>
<p>
“‘Uncle Bill,’ says I, ‘you at it yet?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Hangin’ on, Tumm,’ says he. ‘I isn’t quite
through.’

<p>
“‘Accordin’ t’ the signs,’ says I, ‘you isn’t got
much of a grip left.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Yes, I is!’ says he. ‘I got all my fishin’
fingers exceptin’ two, an’ I ’low they’ll last me
till I’m through.’
</p>
<p>
“Ecod! sir, but it made me think so mean o’
the world that I ’lowed I’d look away.
</p>
<p>
“‘No, Tumm,’ says he, ‘I isn’t <em>quite</em> through.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says I, ‘you must be tired.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Tired,’ says he. ‘Oh no, b’y! Tired? Not
me! I got a little spurt o’ labor t’ do afore <em>I</em>
goes.’
</p>
<p>
“‘An’ what’s that, Uncle Bill?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘But what <em>is</em> it?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much,’ says he; ‘jus’ a little spurt
o’ labor.’
</p>
<p>
“The ol’ feller lived all alone, under Seven
Stars Head, in a bit of a white house with black
trimmin’s, jus’ within the Tickle, where ’twas
nice an’ warm an’ still; an’ he kep’ his house as
neat an’ white as a ol’ maid with a gray tomcat
an’ a window-garden o’ geraniums, an’, like all
the ol’ maids, made the best fish on fifty mile o’
coast. ’Twas said by the ol’ folks o’ Gingerbread
Cove that their fathers knowed the time when
Bill Hulk had a partner; but the partner got lost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
on the Labrador, an’ then Bill Hulk jus’ held on
cotchin’ fish an’ keepin’ house all alone, till he
got the habit an’ couldn’t leave off. Was a time,
I’m told, a time when he had his strength—was a
time, I’m told, afore he wore out—was a time
when Bill Hulk had a bit o’ money stowed away
in a bank t’ St. John’s. Always ’lowed, I’m told,
that ’twas plenty t’ see un through when he got
past his labor. ‘I got enough put by,’ says he.
‘I got more’n enough. I’m jus’ fishin’ along,’
says he, ‘t’ give t’ the poor. Store in your
youth,’ says he, ‘an’ you’ll not want in your age.’
But somehow some o’ them St. John’s gentlemen
managed t’ discover expensive ways o’ delightin’
theirselves; an’ what with bank failures an’ lean
seasons an’ lumbago, ol’ Bill was fallen poor
when first I traded Gingerbread Cove. About
nine year after that, bein’ then used t’ the trade o’
that shore, I ’lowed that Bill had better knock
off an’ lie in the sun till ’twas time for un t’ go t’
his last berth. ‘’Twon’t be long,’ thinks I, ’an’
I ’low my owners can stand it. Anyhow,’ thinks
I, ‘’tis high time the world done something for
Bill.’
</p>
<p>
“But—
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘how many books is kep’
by traders in Newf’un’land?’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
</p>
<p>
“I ’lowed I didn’t know.
</p>
<p>
“‘Call it a round million,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘What of it?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘But what of it?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘if you was t’ look them million
books over, goin’ as easy as you please an’
markin’ off every line o’ every page with your
forefinger, what d’ye think would come t’ pass?’
</p>
<p>
“I ’lowed I couldn’t tell.
</p>
<p>
“‘Eh?’ says he. ‘Come, now! give a guess.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I don’t know, Bill,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Why, Tumm,’ says he, ‘you wouldn’t find
a copper agin the name o’ ol’ Bill Hulk!’
</p>
<p>
“‘That’s good livin’,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Not a copper!’ says he. ‘No, sir; <em>not if
you looked with spectacles</em>. An’ so,’ says he, ‘I
’low I’ll jus’ keep on payin’ my passage for the
little time that’s left. If my back on’y holds
out,’ says he, ‘I’ll manage it till I’m through.
’Twon’t be any more than twenty year. Jus’ a
little spurt o’ labor t’ do, Tumm,’ says he, ‘afore
I goes.’
</p>
<p>
“‘More labor, Uncle Bill?’ says I. ‘God’s
sake!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much,’ says he; ‘jus’ a little spurt
afore I goes in peace.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ah, well! he’d labored long enough, lived
long enough, t’ leave other hands clean up the
litter an’ sweep the room o’ his life. I didn’t
know what that little spurt o’ labor was meant t’
win for his peace o’ mind—didn’t know what he’d
left undone—didn’t know what his wish or his
conscience urged un t’ labor for. I jus’ wanted
un t’ quit an’ lie down in the sun. ‘For,’ thinks I,
‘the world looks wonderful greedy an’ harsh t’
me when I hears ol’ Bill Hulk’s bones rattle over
the roads or come squeakin’ through the Tickle
in his punt. ‘Leave un go in peace!’ thinks I.
‘I isn’t got no love for a world that sends them
bones t’ sea in an easterly wind. Ecod!’ thinks I;
‘but he’ve earned quiet passage by jus’ livin’ t’
that ghastly age—jus’ by hangin’ on off a lee
shore in the mean gales o’ life.’ Seemed t’ me,
too, no matter how Bill felt about it, that he
might be obligin’ an’ quit afore he <em>was</em> through.
Seemed t’ me he might jus’ stop where he was an’
leave the friends an’ neighbors finish up. ’Tisn’t
fair t’ ask a man t’ have his labor done in a ship-shape
way—t’ be through with the splittin’ an’
all cleaned up—when the Skipper sings out,
‘Knock off, ye dunderhead!’ Seems t’ me a
man might leave the crew t’ wash the table an’
swab the deck an’ throw the livers in the cask.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘You be obligin’, Bill,’ says I, ‘an’ quit.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Isn’t able,’ says he, ’till I’m through.’
</p>
<p>
“So the bones o’ ol’ Bill Hulk rattled an’
squeaked right on till it made me fair ache when
I <em>thunk</em> o’ Gingerbread Cove.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“About four year after that I made the Cove
in the spring o’ the year with supplies. ‘Well,’
thinks I, ‘they won’t be no Bill Hulk this season.
With that pain in his back an’ starboard leg, this
winter have finished he; an’ I’ll lay a deal on
that.’ ’Twas afore dawn when we dropped
anchor, an’ a dirty dawn, too, with fog an’ rain,
the wind sharp, an’ the harbor in a tumble for
small craft; but the first man over the side was
ol’ Bill Hulk.
</p>
<p>
“‘It <em>can’t</em> be you, Uncle Bill!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘I isn’t quite through—yet.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You isn’t goin’ at it <em>this</em> season, is you?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says he; ‘goin’ at it again, Tumm.’
</p>
<p>
“‘What for?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘But what <em>for</em>?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘I’m savin’ up.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Savin’ up?’ says I. ‘Shame <em>to</em> you! What
you savin’ up for?’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh,’ says he, ‘jus’ savin’ up.’
</p>
<p>
“‘But what <em>for</em>?’ says I. ‘What’s the sense
of it?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Bit o’ prope’ty,’ says he. ‘I’m thinkin’ o’
makin’ a small investment.’
</p>
<p>
“‘At your age, Uncle Bill!’ says I. ‘An’ a
childless man!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Jus’ a small piece,’ says he. ‘Nothin’ much,
Tumm.’
</p>
<p>
“‘But it won’t do you no <em>good</em>,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well, Tumm,’ says he, ‘I’m sort o’ wantin’
it, an’ I ’low she won’t go t’ waste. I been
fishin’ from Gingerbread Cove for three hundred
year,’ says he, ‘an’ when I knocks off I wants t’
have things ship-shape. Isn’t no comfort, Tumm,’
says he, ‘in knockin’ off no other way.’
</p>
<p>
“Three hundred year he ’lowed he’d fished
from that there harbor, a hook-an’-line man
through it all; an’ as they wasn’t none o’ us abroad
on the coast when he come in, he’d stick to it,
spite o’ parsons. They was a mean little red-headed
parson came near churchin’ un for the
whopper; but Bill Hulk wouldn’t repent. ‘You
isn’t been here long enough t’ <em>know</em>, parson,’ says
he. ‘’Tis goin’ on three hundred year, I tells
you! I’ll haul into my fourth hundred,’ says he,
‘come forty-three year from Friday fortnight.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
Anyhow, he’d been castin’ lines on the Gingerbread
grounds quite long enough. ’Twas like
t’ make a man’s back ache—t’ make his head spin
an’ his stomach shudder—jus’ t’ think o’ the
years o’ labor an’ hardship Bill Hulk had weathered.
Seemed t’ me the very stars must o’ got
fair disgusted t’ watch un put out through the
Tickle afore dawn an’ pull in after dark.
</p>
<p>
“‘Lord!’ says they. ‘If there ain’t Bill Hulk
puttin’ out again! Won’t nothin’ <em>ever</em> happen
t’ he?’”
</p>
<p>
I thought it an unkind imputation.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Tumm explained, “the little beggars
is used t’ change; an’ I wouldn’t wonder if they
was bored a bit by ol’ Bill Hulk.”
</p>
<p>
It might have been.
</p>
<p>
“Four or five year after that,” Tumm proceeded,
“the tail of a sou’east gale slapped me
into Gingerbread Cove, an’ I ’lowed t’ hang the
ol’ girl up till the weather turned civil. Thinks
I, ‘’Tis wonderful dark an’ wet, but ’tis also
wonderful early, an’ I’ll jus’ take a run ashore
t’ yarn an’ darn along o’ ol’ Bill Hulk.’ So I
put a bottle in my pocket t’ warm the ol’ ghost’s
marrow, an’ put out for Seven Stars Head in the
rodney. ’Twas mean pullin’ agin the wind, but
I fetched the stage-head ’t last, an’ went crawlin’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
up the hill. Thinks I, ‘They’s no sense in knockin’
in a gale o’ wind like this, for Bill Hulk’s so
wonderful hard o’ hearin’ in a sou’east blow.’
</p>
<p>
“So I drove on in.
</p>
<p>
“‘Lord’s sake, Bill!’ says I, ‘what you up to?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much, Tumm,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘It don’t look right,’ says I. ‘What <em>is</em> it?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much,’ says he; ‘jus’ countin’ up
my money.’
</p>
<p>
“’Twas true enough: there he sot—playin’
with his fortune. They was pounds of it:
coppers an’ big round pennies an’ silver an’ one
lone gold piece.
</p>
<p>
“‘You been gettin’ rich?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘you got any clear idea o’
how much hard cash they is lyin’ right there on
that plain deal table in this here very kitchen
you is in?’
</p>
<p>
“‘I isn’t,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘they’s as much as fourteen
dollar! An’ what d’ye think o’ that?’
</p>
<p>
“I ’lowed I’d hold my tongue; so I jus’ lifted
my eyebrow, an’ then sort o’ whistled, ‘Whew!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Fourteen,’ says he, ‘an’ more!’
</p>
<p>
“‘<em>Whew!</em>’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘An’, Tumm,’ says he, ‘I had twenty-four
sixty once—about eighteen year ago.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘You got a heap now,’ says I. ‘Fourteen
dollar! Whew!’
</p>
<p>
“‘No, Tumm!’ cries he, all of a sudden. ‘No,
no! I been lyin’ t’ you. I been lyin’!’ says he.
‘Lyin’!’
</p>
<p>
“‘I don’t care,’ says I; ‘you go right ahead an’
lie.’
</p>
<p>
“‘They <em>isn’t</em> fourteen dollar there,’ says he.
‘I jus’ been makin’ <em>believe</em> they was. See that
there little pile o’ pennies t’ the nor’east? I been
sittin’ here countin’ in them pennies twice. They
isn’t fourteen dollar,’ says he; ‘they’s on’y thirteen
eighty-four! But I <em>wisht</em> they was fourteen.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Never you mind,’ says I; ‘you’ll get that bit
o’ prope’ty yet.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I <em>got</em> to,’ says he, ‘afore I goes.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Where does it lie?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, ’tisn’t nothin’ much, Tumm,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘But what <em>is</em> it?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much,’ says he; ‘jus’ a small piece.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Is it meadow?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says he; ‘tisn’t what you might call
meadow an’ be right, though the grass grows
there, in spots, knee high.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Is it a potato-patch?’
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says he; ‘nor yet a patch.’
</p>
<p>
“‘’Tisn’t a <em>flower</em> garden, is it?’ says I.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘N-no,’ says he; ‘you couldn’t rightly say so—though
they <em>grows</em> there, in spots, quite free
an’ nice.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Uncle Bill,’ says I, ‘you isn’t never told me
nothin’ about that there bit o’ prope’ty. What’s
it held at?’
</p>
<p>
“‘The prope’ty isn’t much, Tumm,’ says he.
‘Jus’ a small piece.’
</p>
<p>
“‘But how much <em>is</em> it?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Tom Neverbudge,’ says he, ‘is holdin’ it at
twenty-four dollar; he’ve come down one in the
las’ seven year. But I’m on’y ’lowin’ t’ pay
twenty-one; you sees I’ve come <em>up</em> one in the las’
<em>four</em> year.’
</p>
<p>
“‘’Twould not be hard t’ split the difference,’
says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says he; ‘but they’s a wonderful good
reason for not payin’ more’n twenty-one for that
there special bit o’ land.’
</p>
<p>
“‘What’s that?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘’tis second-handed.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Second-handed!’ says I. ‘That’s queer!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Been used,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Used, Uncle Bill?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says he; ‘been used—been used, now,
for nigh sixty year.’
</p>
<p>
“‘She’s all wore out?’ says I.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says he; ‘not wore out.’
</p>
<p>
“‘<em>She’d</em> grow nothin’?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘nothin’ much is expected,
Tumm,’ says he, ‘in that line.’
</p>
<p>
“I give a tug at my pocket, an’, ecod! out
jumped the bottle o’ Scotch.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well, well!’ says he. ‘Dear man! But I
bet ye,’ says he, ‘that you isn’t fetched no pain-killer.’
</p>
<p>
“‘That I is!’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Then,’ says he, ‘about half an’ half, Tumm,
with a dash o’ water; that’s the way I likes it
when I takes it.’
</p>
<p>
“So we fell to, ol’ Bill Hulk an’ me, on the
Scotch an’ the pain-killer.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
“Well, now, after that,” Tumm resumed,
presently, “I went deep sea for four year in the
South American fish trade; an’ then, my ol’ berth
on the <em>Quick as Wink</em> bein’ free of incumbrance—’twas
a saucy young clerk o’ the name o’ Bullyworth—I
’lowed t’ blow the fever out o’ my
system with the gales o’ this here coast. ‘A
whiff or two o’ real wind an’ a sight o’ Mother
Burke,’ thinks I, ‘will fix <em>me</em>.’ ’Twas a fine
Sunday mornin’ in June when I fetched Gingerbread
Cove in the ol’ craft—warm an’ blue an’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span>
still an’ sweet t’ smell. ‘They’ll be no Bill Hulk,
thank God!’ thinks I, ‘t’ be crawlin’ up the hill t’
meetin’ <em>this</em> day; <em>he’ve</em> got through an’ gone t’
his berth for all time. I’d like t’ yarn with un
on this fine civil Sunday,’ thinks I; ‘but I ’low
he’s jus’ as glad as I is that he’ve been stowed
away nice an’ comfortable at last.’ But from
the deck, ecod! when I looked up from shavin’,
an’ Skipper Jim was washin’ up in the forecastle,
I cotched sight o’ ol’ Bill Hulk, bound up
the hill through the sunshine, makin’ tolerable
weather of it, with the wind astern, a staff in his
hand, and the braw black coat on his back.
</p>
<p>
“‘Skipper Jim,’ sings I, t’ the skipper below,
‘you hear a queer noise?’
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ like a squeak or a rattle?’
</p>
<p>
“‘No,’ says he. ‘What’s awry?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, nothin’ says I:’ on’y ol’ Bill Hulk’s on
the road.’
</p>
<p>
“I watched un crawl through the little door on
Meetin’-house Hill long after ol’ Sammy Street
had knocked off pullin’ the bell; an’ if I didn’t
hear neither squeak nor rattle as he crep’ along,
why, I <em>felt</em> un, anyhow, which is jus’ as hard to
bear. ‘Well,’ thinks I, ‘he’ve kep’ them bones
above ground, poor man! but he’s never <em>at</em> it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
yet. He’ve knocked off for good,’ thinks I; ‘he’ll
stumble t’ meetin’ of a fine Sunday mornin’, an’
sit in the sun for a spell; an’ then,’ thinks I,
‘they’ll stow un away where he belongs.’ So I
went aboard of un that evenin’ for a last bit
of a yarn afore his poor ol’ throat rattled an’
quit.
</p>
<p>
“‘So,’ says I, ‘you is at it yet?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay, Tumm,’ says he; ‘isn’t quite through—yet.
But,’ says he, ‘I’m ’lowin’ t’ <em>be</em>.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Hard at it, Uncle Bill?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well, no, Tumm,’ says he; ‘not hard. Back
give warnin’ a couple o’ year ago,’ says he, ‘an’
I been sort o’ easin’ off for fear o’ accident. I’ve
quit the Far Away grounds,’ says he, ‘but I been
doin’ very fair on Widows’ Shoal. They’s on’y
one o’ them fishin’ there nowadays, ah’ she
’lowed she didn’t care.’
</p>
<p>
“‘An’ when,’ says I, ‘is you ’lowin’ t’ knock
off?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Jus’ as soon as I gets through, Tumm,’ says
he. ‘I won’t be a minute longer.’
</p>
<p>
“Then along come the lean-cheeked, pig-eyed,
scrawny-whiskered son of a squid which owned
the bit o’ prope’ty that Bill Hulk had coveted for
thirty year. Man o’ the name o’ Tom Budge;
but as he seldom done it, they called un Neverbudge;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
an’ Gingerbread Cove is full o’ Never-budges
t’ this day. Bill ’lowed I might as well
go along o’ he an’ Tom t’ overhaul the bit o’ land
they was tryin’ t’ trade; so out we put on the
inland road—round Burnt Bight, over the crest
o’ Knock Hill, an’ along the alder-fringed path.
’Twas in a green, still, soft-breasted little valley—a
little pool o’ sunshine an’ grass among the
hills—with Ragged Ridge t’ break the winds from
the sea, an’ the wooded slope o’ the Hog’s Back
t’ stop the nor’westerly gales. ’Twas a lovely
spot, sir, believe me, an’ a gentle-hearted one,
too, lyin’ deep in the warmth an’ glory o’ sunshine,
where a man might lay his head on the
young grass an’ go t’ sleep, not mindin’ about
nothin’ no more. Ol’ Bill Hulk liked it wonderful
well. Wasn’t no square o’ ground on that
coast that he’d rather own, says he, than the little
plot in the sou’east corner o’ that graveyard.
</p>
<p>
“‘Sight rather have that, Tumm,’ says he,
‘than a half-acre farm.’
</p>
<p>
“’Twas so soft an’ snug an’ sleepy an’ still in
that little graveyard that I couldn’t blame un
for wantin’ t’ stretch out somewheres an’ stay
there forever.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says he, ‘an’ a thirty-foot potato-patch
throwed in!’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘‘’Tis yours at the price,’ says Tom Neverbudge.
</p>
<p>
“‘<em>If</em>,’ says Bill Hulk, ‘’twasn’t a second-handed
plot. See them graves in the sou’west corner,
Tumm?’
</p>
<p>
“Graves o’ two children, sir: jus’ on’y that—laid
side by side, sir, where the sunlight lingered
afore the shadow o’ Hog’s Back fell.
</p>
<p>
“‘Been there nigh sixty year,’ says Bill. ‘Pity,’
says he; ‘wonderful pity.’
</p>
<p>
“‘They won’t do you no harm,’ says Neverbudge.
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says Bill; ‘but I’m a bachelor, Tom,
used t’ sleepin’ alone,’ says he, ‘an’ I’m ’lowin’ I
wouldn’t take so wonderful quick t’ any other
habit. I’m told,’ says he, ‘that sleepin’ along o’
children isn’t what you might call a easy berth.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You’d soon get used t’ <em>that</em>,’ says Neverbudge.
‘Any family man’ll tell you so.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says Bill; ‘but they isn’t kin o’ mine.
Why,’ says he, ‘they isn’t even friends!’
</p>
<p>
“‘That don’t matter,’ says Neverbudge.
</p>
<p>
“‘Not matter!’ says he. ‘Can you tell me,
Tom Neverbudge, the <em>names</em> o’ them children?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Not me.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Nor yet their father’s name?’
</p>
<p>
“‘No, sir.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘Then,’ says Bill, ‘as a religious man, is you
able t’ tell me they was born in a proper an’
perfeckly religious manner?’
</p>
<p>
“‘I isn’t,’ says Neverbudge. ‘I guarantees
nothin’.’
</p>
<p>
“‘An’ yet, as a religious man,’ says Bill, ‘you
stands there an’ says it doesn’t matter?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Anyhow,’ says Neverbudge, ‘it doesn’t matter
<em>much</em>’
</p>
<p>
“‘Not much!’ cries Bill. ‘An’ you a religious
man! Not much t’ lie for good an’ all,’ says he,
‘in the company o’ the damned?’
</p>
<p>
“With that Tom Neverbudge put off in a rage.
</p>
<p>
“‘Uncle Billy,’ says I, ‘what you wantin’
that plot for, anyhow? ’Tis so damp ’tis fair
swampy.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘But what <em>for?</em>’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘I wants it.’
</p>
<p>
“‘An’ ’tis on a side-hill,’ says I. ‘If the
dunderheads doesn’t dig with care, you’ll find
yourself with your feet higher’n your head.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘I wants it.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You isn’t got no friends in this neighborhood,’
says I; ‘they’re all put away on the north
side. An’ the sun,’ says I, ‘doesn’t strike here
last.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘I wants it,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘What for?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much,’ says he; ‘but I wants it.’
</p>
<p>
“‘But what for?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, in a temper, ‘I got a <em>hankerin’</em>
for it!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Then, Uncle Bill,’ says I, for it made me
sad,’ I wouldn’t mind them little graves. They’re
poor wee things,’ says I, ‘an’ they wouldn’t disturb
your rest.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Hush!’ says he. ‘Don’t—<em>don’t</em> say that!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Graves o’ children,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Don’t say no more, Tumm,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jus’ on’y poor little kids,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Stop!’ says he. ‘Doesn’t you see I’m
cryin’?’
</p>
<p>
“Then up come Tom Neverbudge. ‘Look
you, Bill Hulk!’ says he, ‘you can take that plot
or leave it. I’ll knock off seventy-five cents on
account o’ the risk you take in them children.
Come now!’ says he; ‘you take it or leave it.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Twenty-one fifty,’ says Bill. ‘That’s a raise
o’ fifty, Tom.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Then,’ says Tom, ‘I’ll use that plot meself.’
</p>
<p>
“Bill Hulk jumped. ‘You!’ says he. ‘Nothin’
gone wrong along o’ you, is they, Tom?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Not yet,’ says Tom; ‘but they might.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘No chill,’ says Bill, ‘an’ no fever? No ache
in your back, is they, Tom?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Nar a ache.’
</p>
<p>
“‘An’ you isn’t give up the Labrador?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Not me!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, well,’ says Bill, feelin’ easy again, ‘I
’low <em>you</em> won’t never need no graveyard.’
</p>
<p>
“Tom Neverbudge up canvas an’ went off
afore the wind in a wonderful temper; an’ then
ol’ Bill Hulk an’ me took the homeward road.
I remembers the day quite well—the low, warm
sun, the long shadows, the fresh youth an’ green
o’ leaves an’ grass, the tinkle o’ bells on the hills,
the reaches o’ sea, the peace o’ weather an’
Sabbath day. I remembers it well: the wheeze
an’ groan o’ ol’ Bill—crawlin’ home, sunk deep
in the thought o’ graves—an’ the tender, bedtime
twitter o’ the new-mated birds in the alders.
When we rounded Fish Head Rock—’tis half-way
from the graveyard—I seed a lad an’ a maid
flit back from the path t’ hide whilst we crep’ by;
an’ they was a laugh on the lad’s lips, an’ a smile
an’ a sweet blush on the maid’s young face, as
maids will blush an’ lads will laugh when love
lifts un high. ’Twas at that spot I cotched ear
of a sound I knowed quite well, havin’ made it
meself, thank God! many a time an’ gladly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
</p>
<p>
“Bill Hulk stopped dead in the path. ‘What’s
that?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Is you not knowin’?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘I’ve heared it afore,’ says he, ‘somewheres.’
</p>
<p>
“Twas a kiss,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, in a sort o’ scared whisper,
‘<em>is they at that yet in the world?</em>’
</p>
<p>
“‘Jus’ as they used t’ be,’ says I, ‘when you
was young.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Well,’ says he, ‘jig <em>me!</em>’
</p>
<p>
“Then I knowed, somehow, jus’ how old ol’
Bill Hulk must be.
</p>
<p>
“Well, thereafter,” Tumm continued, with a
sigh and a genial little smile, “they come lean
years an’ they come fat ones, as always, by the
mystery o’ God. Ol’ Bill Hulk drove along
afore the wind, with his last rags o’ sail all spread,
his fortune lean or fat as the Lord’s own seasons
’lowed. He’d fall behind or crawl ahead jus’
accordin’ t’ the way a careful hand might divide
fish by hunger; but I ’lowed, by an’ all, he
was overhaulin’ Tom Neverbudge’s twenty-three
twenty-five, an’ would surely make it if the wind
held true a few years longer. ‘Twelve thirty
more, Tumm,’ says he, ‘an’ if ’twasn’t for the
pork I might manage it this season. The longer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
you lives, Tumm,’ says he, ‘the more expensive
it gets. Cost me four fifty las’ season for
Dr. Hook’s Surecure Egyptian Lumbago Oil,
an’ one fifty, Tumm, for a pair o’ green glasses
t’ fend off blindness from the aged. An’ I jus’ got
t’ have pork t’ keep my ol’ bones warm. I don’t
<em>want</em> no pork,’ says he; ‘but they isn’t no heat in
flour, an’, anyhow, I got t’ build my shoulder
muscles up. You take a ol’ hulk like mine,’ says
he, ‘an’ you’ll find it a wonderful expensive craft
t’ keep in sailin’ order.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You stick t’ pork,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘I was thinkin’,’ says he, ‘o’ makin’ a small
investment in a few bottles o’ Hook’s Vigor.
Clerk o’ the <em>Free for All</em>,’ says he, ‘’lows ’tis a
wonderful nostrum t’ make the old feel young.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You stick t’ pork,’ says I, ‘an’ be damned
t’ the clerk o’ the <em>Free for All</em>.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Maybe I better,’ says he, ‘an’ build up my
shoulders. They jus’ <em>got</em> t’ be humored.’
</p>
<p>
“Ol’ Bill Hulk always ’lowed that if by God’s
chance they’d on’y come a fair fishin’ season
afore his shoulders give out he’d make a self-respectin’
haul an’ be through. ‘Back give out
about thirteen year ago,’ says he, ‘the time I got
cotched by a dirty nor’easter on the Bull’s Horn
grounds. One o’ them strings back there sort
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
o’ went an’ snapped,’ says he, ‘jus’ as I was
pullin’ in the Tickle, an’ she isn’t been o’ much
use t’ me since. Been rowin’ with my shoulders
for a little bit past,’ says he, ‘an’ doin’ very fair in
southerly weather; but I got a saucy warnin’,’
says he, ‘that they won’t stand nothin’ from the
nor’east. “No, sir,” says they; “nothin’ from
the nor’east for we, Bill Hulk, an’ don’t you put
us to it!” I’m jus’ a bit afeared,’ says he, ‘that
they might get out o’ temper in a southerly tumble;
an’ if they done that, why, I’d jus’ have t’ stop,
dear Lord!’ says he, ‘’ithout bein’ through! Isn’t
got no legs t’ speak of,’ says he, ‘but I don’t need
none. I got my arms runnin’ free,’ says he,’ an’
I got one thumb an’ all my fishin’ fingers ’ceptin’
two. Lungs,’ says he, ‘is so-so; they wheezes,
Tumm, as you knows, an’ they labors in a fog,
an’ aches all the time, but chances is they’ll <em>last</em>,
an’ a fair man can’t ask no more. As for liver,
Tumm,’ says he, ‘they isn’t a liver on these here
coasts t’ touch the liver I got. Why,’ says he, ‘I
never knowed I had one till I was told!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Liver,’ says I, ‘is a ticklish business.’
</p>
<p>
“‘’Lowin’ a man didn’t overeat,’ says he,
‘think he could spurt along for a spell on his
liver?’
</p>
<p>
“‘I does,’ says I.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘That’s good,’ says he; ‘for I’m countin’ a
deal on she.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Never you fear,’ says I. ‘<em>She’ll</em> stand
you.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Think she will?’ says he, jus’ like a child.
‘Maybe, then,’ says he, ‘with my own labor,
Tumm, I’ll buy my own grave at last!’
</p>
<p>
“But the season bore hard on the ol’ man, an’
when I balanced un up in the fall o’ the year,
the twelve thirty he’d been t’ leeward o’ the twenty-three
twenty-five Tom Neverbudge wanted for
the plot where the two little graves lay side by
side had growed t’ fifteen ninety-three.
</p>
<p>
“‘Jus’ where I was nine year ago,’ says he,
‘lackin’ thirty-four cents.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Never you fear,’ says I
</p>
<p>
“‘My God! Tumm,’ says he, ‘I got t’ do better
nex’ season.’”
</p>
<p>
Tumm paused to gaze at the stars.
</p>
<p>
“Still there,” I ventured.
</p>
<p>
“Winkin’ away,” he answered, “the wise little
beggars!”
</p>
<p>
The <em>Good Samaritan</em> dawdled onward.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now, sir,” Tumm continued, “winter
tumbled down on Gingerbread Cove, thick an’
heavy, with nor’east gales an’ mountains o’ snow;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
but ol’ Bill Hulk weathered it out on his own
hook, an’ by March o’ that season, I’m told, had
got so far along with his shoulder muscles that
he went swilin’ [sealing] with the Gingerbread
men at the first offshore sign. ’Twas a big pack,
four mile out on the floe, with rough ice, a drear
gray day, an’ the wind in a nasty temper. He
done very well, I’m told, what with the legs he
had, an’ was hard at it when the wind changed
to a westerly gale an’ drove the ice t’ sea. They
wasn’t no hope for Bill, with four mile o’ ice
atween him an’ the shore, an’ every chunk an’
pan o’ the floe in a mad hurry under the wind:
<em>they</em> knowed it an’ <em>he</em> knowed it. ‘Lads,’ says
he, ‘you jus’ run along home or you’ll miss your
supper. As for me,’ says he, ‘why, I’ll jus’
keep on swilin’. Might as well make a haul,’
says he, ‘whatever comes of it.’ The last they
seed o’ Bill, I’m told, he was still hard at it,
gettin’ his swiles on a likely pan; an’ they all
come safe t’ land, every man o’ them, ’ceptin’
two young fellers, I’m told, which was lost in
a jam off the Madman’s Head. Wind blowed
westerly all that night, I’m told, but fell jus’ after
dawn; an’ then they nosed poor ol’ Bill out o’ the
floe, where they found un buried t’ the neck in
his own dead swiles, for the warmth of the life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300'></a>300</span>
they’d had, but hard put to it t’ keep the spark
alight in his own chilled breast.
</p>
<p>
“‘Maybe I’m through,’ says he, when they’d
got un ashore; ‘but I’ll hang on so long as I’m
able.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Uncle Billy,’ says they, ‘you’re good for
twenty year yet.’
</p>
<p>
“‘No tellin’,’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, sure!’ says they; ‘you’ll do it.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Anyhow,’ says he, ‘now that you’ve fetched
me t’ <em>land</em>,’ says he, ‘I got t’ hang on till the
<em>Quick as Wink</em> comes in.’
</p>
<p>
“‘What for?’ says they.
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much,’ says he; ‘but I jus’ got to.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You go t’ bed,’ says they, ‘an’ we’ll stow
them swile in the stage.’
</p>
<p>
“‘I’ll lie down an’ warm up,’ says he, ‘an’ rest
for a spell. Jus’ a little spurt,’ says he, ‘jus’ a
little spurt—o’ rest.’
</p>
<p>
“‘You’ve made a wonderful haul,’ says they.
</p>
<p>
“‘At last!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Rest easy,’ says they, ‘as t’ that.’
</p>
<p>
“’Twas the women that put un t’ bed.
</p>
<p>
“‘Seems t’ me,’ says he, ‘that the frost has bit
my heart.’
</p>
<p>
“So ol’ Bill Hulk was flat on his back when
I made Gingerbread Cove with supplies in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301'></a>301</span>
first o’ that season—anchored there in bed, sir,
at last, with no mortal hope o’ makin’ the
open sea again. Lord! how white an’ withered
an’ cold he was! From what a far-off place
in age an’ pain an’ weariness he looked back
at me!
</p>
<p>
“‘I been waitin’, Tumm,’ says he. ‘Does
you hear?’
</p>
<p>
“I bent close t’ hear.
</p>
<p>
“‘I’m in a hurry,’ says he. ‘Isn’t got no
chance t’ pass the time o’ day. Does you hear?’
</p>
<p>
“‘Ay,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘I got hopes,’ says he. ‘Tom Neverbudge
haves come down t’ twenty-two seventy-five.
You’ll find a old sock in the corner locker,
Tumm,’ says he, ‘with my fortune in the toe.
Pass un here. An’ hurry, Tumm, hurry, for I
isn’t got much of a grip left! Now, Tumm,’
says he, ‘measure the swile oil in the stage an’
balance me up for the las’ time.’
</p>
<p>
“‘How much you got in that sock?’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Nothin’ much,’ says he. ‘Jus’ a little left
over.’
</p>
<p>
“‘But <em>how</em> much?’
</p>
<p>
“‘I’m not wantin’ t’ tell,’ says he, ‘lest you
cheat me with kindness. I’d have you treat me
as a man, come what will.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302'></a>302</span>
</p>
<p>
“‘So help me God! then, Bill Hulk,’ says I,
‘I’ll strike that balance fair.’
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm!’ he called.
</p>
<p>
“I turned in the door.
</p>
<p>
“‘Oh, make haste!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“I measured the swile oil, neither givin’ nor
takin’ a drop, an’ I boarded the <em>Quick as Wink</em>,
where I struck ol’ Bill Hulk’s las’ balance, fair t’
the penny, as atween a man an’ a man. Ah!
but ’twas hard, sir, t’ add no copper t’ the mean
small total that faced me from the page: for the
fortune in the toe o’ Bill Hulk’s ol’ sock was
light enough, God knows! when I passed un
over.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, ‘is it a honest balance?’
</p>
<p>
“‘It is,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Wait a minute!’ says he. ‘Jus’ a minute
afore you tells me. I isn’t quite ready.’
</p>
<p>
“I watched the sun drop into the sea while I
waited.
</p>
<p>
“‘Now,’ says he, ‘tell me quick!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Nine eighty-three,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“’Add t’ that,’ says he, ‘the twelve ninety-three
in the sock. Quick, Tumm!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“I scribbled it out.
</p>
<p>
“‘Wait!’ says he. ‘Just a minute, Tumm,
till I gets a better grip.’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303'></a>303</span>
</p>
<p>
“I seed ’twas growin’ quite gray in the west.
</p>
<p>
“‘Now!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Uncle Billy,’ roars I, ‘tis twenty-two seventy-six!’
</p>
<p>
“‘Send for Tom Neverbudge!’ cries he: ‘for
I done it—thank God, I done it!’
</p>
<p>
“I fetched Tom Neverbudge with me own
hands t’ trade that grave for the fortune o’ ol’
Bill Hulk,” Tumm proceeded, “an’ I seed for
meself, as atween a party o’ the first part an’ a
party o’ the second, that ’twas all aboveboard an’
ship-shape, makin’ what haste I was able, for
Bill Hulk’s anchor chain showed fearful signs
o’ givin’ out.
</p>
<p>
“‘Is it done?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘All fast,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘A plot an’ a penny left over!’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘A plot an’ a penny,’ says I.
</p>
<p>
“‘Tumm,’ says he, with a little smile, ‘I needs
the plot, but <em>you</em> take the penny. ’Tis sort o’
surprisin’,’ says he, ‘an’ wonderful nice, too, t’
be able t’ make a bequest. I’d like t’ do it,
Tumm,’ says he, ‘jus’ for the feel of it, if you
don’t mind the size.’
</p>
<p>
“I ’lowed I’d take it an’ be glad.
</p>
<p>
“‘Look you! Bill Hulk,’ says Neverbudge,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304'></a>304</span>
‘if them graves is goin’ t’ trouble you, I’ll move
un an’ pay the cost o’ labor. There, now!’ says
he; ‘that’s kind enough.’
</p>
<p>
“Bill Hulk got up on his elbow. ‘<em>What</em>’ll
you do along o’ my plot?’ says he.
</p>
<p>
“‘Move them graves,’ says Neverbudge.
</p>
<p>
“‘You leave my plot be, Tom Neverbudge!’
says Bill. ‘What you think I been wantin’ t’ lie
in that plot for, anyhow?’
</p>
<p>
“Tom Neverbudge ’lowed he didn’t know.
</p>
<p>
“‘Why,’ says ol’ Bill Hulk, ‘jus’ t’ lie alongside
them poor lonely little kids!’
</p>
<p>
“I let un fall back on the pillow.
</p>
<p>
“‘I’m through, Tumm,’ says he, ‘an’ I ’low
I’ll quit.’
</p>
<p>
“Straightway he quit....”
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Wind astern, moonlight and mist upon the
sea, a serene and tender sky, with a multitude of
stars benignantly peeping from its mystery: and
the <em>Good Samaritan</em> dawdled on, wing and wing
to the breeze, bound across from Sinners’ Tickle
to Afterward Bight, there to deal for the first of
the catch. Tumm looked up to the sky. He was
smiling in a gentle, wistful way. A little psa’m
from his Bible? Again I wondered concerning
the lesson. “Wink away,” said he, “you little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305'></a>305</span>
beggars! Wink away—wink away! You been
lookin’ at this damned thing so long that no
wonder you winks. Wink away! I’m glad
you’ve the heart t’ do it. I’m not troubled by
fears when you winks down, you’re so wonderful
wiser’n we. Wink on, you knowin’ little
beggars!”
</p>
<p>
This, then, it seemed, was the lesson.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
